The Fund's investments may include securities issued by domestic and foreign governments, corporate entities, and trust structures. The Fund may invest in a broad array of securities, including: securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities; corporate bonds; commercial paper; mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities; and loans. Securities in which the Fund may invest may be structured as fixed rate debt; floating rate debt; and debt that may not pay interest at the time of issuance. The Fund may invest in debt securities across the credit spectrum, including investment grade securities, below investment grade securities and unrated securities, and may invest without limit in below investment grade securities (""high yield bonds,"" commonly known as ""junk bonds""). The Fund considers debt securities to be below investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories by at least one independent credit rating agency or, if unrated, are determined by the Portfolio Managers to be of comparable quality. The Fund does not normally invest in or continue to hold securities that are in default or have defaulted with respect to the payment of interest or repayment of principal, but may do so depending on market conditions. The Fund may invest in securities whose ratings imply an imminent risk of default with respect to such payments. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments as a means of hedging risk and/or for investment purposes, which may include altering the Fund's exposure to interest rates, sectors and individual issuers. These derivative instruments may include futures, forward foreign currency contracts, and swaps, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. The Fund may also invest without limit in foreign securities, but normally will not invest more than 25% of its total assets at the time of investment in obligations of issuers in emerging market countries. The Fund defines emerging market countries as those countries included in the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index-Global Diversified Index. Additionally, the Fund may invest in tender option bonds, convertible securities and preferred securities. The Fund may also engage in when-issued and delayed-delivery transactions (such as to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities), which involve a commitment by the Fund to purchase securities that will be issued at a later date. The Fund may also hold short-term securities including cash, cash equivalents and other debt obligations. The Fund may invest in debt securities of any maturity and does not have a target average duration. In an effort to achieve its goal, the Fund may engage in active and frequent trading. The Fund may change its goal without shareholder approval, although it does not currently intend to do so. Investment Philosophy and Process The Portfolio Management Team' s investment philosophy is rooted in the belief that positive results can be achieved through a consistently applied, risk-managed approach to portfolio management that leverages the unique strengths of its proprietary fundamental research capabilities, decision-making frameworks, and quantitative risk management tools. The Portfolio Management Team employs an integrated investment process in managing the Fund. ■ Portfolio Strategy: The Global Investment Strategy Team, which consists of the Portfolio Management Team and other senior investment professionals, establishes the investment profile for the Fund, which it monitors on an ongoing basis, including exposures to sectors (such as government, structured debt, credit, etc.) and duration/yield curve positioning, utilizing internally generated data that are produced by specialty sector investment teams in conjunction with asset allocation tools. 2 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2013 ■ Strategy Implementation: Once the Global Investment Strategy Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, the research teams and the Portfolio Management Team determine industry/sub-sector weightings and make securities selections within the types of securities that the Fund can purchase, such as investment grade securities, below investment grade securities, emerging market securities and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. When assessing the worth of a particular security, the teams utilize internally generated research and proprietary quantitatively driven tools and frameworks to a) establish an internal outlook, b) evaluate the market's outlook as it is reflected in asset prices, and c) contrast the two. The goal is to identify and evaluate investment opportunities that others may have missed.","Most of the Fund's performance depends on what happens in the bond market. The market's behavior is unpredictable, particularly in the short term. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its goal. The Fund is a mutual fund, not a bank deposit, and is not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. The following factors can significantly affect the Fund's performance: Market Volatility. Markets are volatile and values of individual securities and other investments can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments that may cause broad changes in market value. Issuer-Specific Risk. The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently from the value of the market as a whole. Interest Rate Risk. The Fund's yield and share price will fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates. In general, the value of investments with interest rate risk, such as fixed income securities, will move in the direction opposite to movements in interest rates. In general, the longer the maturity or duration of a fixed income security, the greater the effect a change in interest rates could have on the security's price. Thus, the Fund's sensitivity to interest rate risk will increase with any increase in the Fund's overall duration. An increase in interest rates can impact other markets as well. For example, because many investors buy derivatives with borrowed money, an increase in interest rates can cause a decline in those markets. Interest rates have been unusually low in recent years. Floating rate securities (including loans) can be less sensitive to interest rate changes. Prepayment and Extension Risk. The Fund's performance could be affected if unexpected interest rate trends cause the Fund's mortgage- or asset-backed securities to be paid off earlier or later than expected, shortening or lengthening their duration. An increase in market interest rates would likely extend the effective duration of mortgage-backed securities, thereby magnifying the effect of the rate increase on the securities' price. Call Risk. When interest rates are low, issuers will often repay the obligation underlying a ""callable security"" early, in which case the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in an investment offering a lower yield and may not benefit from any increase in value that might otherwise result from declining interest rates. Credit Risk. A downgrade or default affecting any of the Fund's securities could affect the Fund's performance. U.S. Government Securities Risk. Although the Fund may hold securities that carry U.S. government guarantees, these guarantees do not extend to shares of the Fund itself and do not guarantee the market price of the securities. Furthermore, not all securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies and instrumentalities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Lower-Rated Debt Securities Risk. Lower-rated debt securities (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities. Lower-rated debt securities may fluctuate more widely in price and yield than investment grade debt securities and may fall in price during times when the economy is weak or is expected to become weak. Lower-rated debt securities carry a greater risk that the issuer of such securities will default in the timely payment of principal and interest. Issuers of securities that are in default may fail to resume principal or interest payments, in which case the Fund may lose its entire investment. When-Issued and Delayed-Delivery Securities Risk. When-issued and delayed-delivery securities can have a leverage like effect on the Fund, which can increase fluctuations in the Fund's share price; may cause the Fund to liquidate positions when 3 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2013 it may not be advantageous to do so, in order to satisfy its purchase obligations; and are subject to the risk that a counterparty may fail to complete the sale of the security, in which case the Fund may lose the opportunity to purchase or sell the security at the agreed upon price. Loan Interests Risk. Loans generally are subject to restrictions on transfer, and the Fund may be unable to sell loans at a time when it may otherwise be desirable to do so or may be able to sell them only at prices that are less than what the Fund regards as their fair market value. Loans may be difficult to value. There is a risk that the value of the collateral securing a loan may decline after the Fund invests and that the collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed to the Fund. In the event the borrower defaults, the Fund's access to the collateral may be limited or delayed by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws. Further, in the event of a default, second lien secured loans will generally be paid only if the value of the collateral is sufficient to satisfy the borrower's obligations to the first lien secured lenders and even then, the remaining collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed to the Fund. If the Fund acquires a participation interest in a loan, the Fund may not be able to control the exercise of any remedies that the lender would have under the loan and likely would not have any rights against the borrower directly. Loans made to finance highly leveraged corporate acquisitions may be especially vulnerable to adverse changes in economic or market conditions. Foreign and Emerging Market Risk. Foreign securities, including those issued by foreign governments, involve risks in addition to those associated with comparable U.S. securities. Additional risks include exposure to less developed or less efficient trading markets; social, political or economic instability; fluctuations in foreign currencies or currency redenomination; potential for default on sovereign debt; nationalization or expropriation of assets; settlement, custodial or other operational risks; and less stringent auditing and legal standards. As a result, foreign securities can fluctuate more widely in price, and may also be less liquid, than comparable U.S. securities. World markets, or those in a particular region, may all react in similar fashion to important economic or political developments. In addition, foreign markets can perform differently than the U.S. market. Following the market turmoil of 2008-2009, some national economies continue to show profound instability, which may in turn affect their international trading and financial partners. Investing in emerging market countries involves risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign countries. Securities of issuers in emerging market countries may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of issuers in foreign countries with more developed economies or markets. Currency Risk. Currency fluctuations could negatively impact investment gains or add to investment losses. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives involve risks different from, and in some respects greater than, those associated with more traditional investments. Derivatives can be highly complex, can create investment leverage and may be highly volatile, and the Fund could lose more than the amount it invests. Derivatives may be difficult to value and may at times be highly illiquid, and the Fund may not be able to close out or sell a derivative position at a particular time or at an anticipated price. The Fund's investments in derivatives create counterparty risk related to the risk that a futures commission merchant (""FCM"" ) would default on an obligation set forth in an agreement between the Fund and the FCM. Recent legislation calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets and could limit the Fund's ability to pursue its investment strategies. The extent and impact of the regulation are not yet fully known and may not be for some time. New regulation of derivatives may make them more costly, may limit their availability, or may otherwise adversely affect their value or performance. Sector Risk. To the extent the Fund invests more heavily in particular bond market sectors, its performance will be especially sensitive to developments that significantly affect those sectors. Individual sectors may move up and down more than the broader market. The industries that constitute a sector may all react in the same way to economic, political or regulatory events. Restricted Securities Risk. Restricted securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to the Fund. Illiquid Investments Risk. Illiquid investments may be more difficult to purchase or sell at an advantageous price or time, and there is a greater risk that the investments may not be sold for the price at which the Fund is carrying them. High Portfolio Turnover. The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading and may have a high portfolio turnover rate, which may increase the Fund's transaction costs, may adversely affect the Fund's performance and/or may generate a greater amount of capital gain distributions to shareholders than if the Fund had a low portfolio turnover rate. 4 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2013 Risk Management. Risk is an essential part of investing. No risk management program can eliminate the Fund's exposure to adverse events; at best, it can only reduce the possibility that the Fund will be affected by such events, and especially those risks that are not intrinsic to the Fund's investment program. Recent Market Conditions. The financial crisis in the U.S. and many foreign economies over the past several years, including the European sovereign debt and banking crises, has resulted, and may continue to result, in an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and in the net asset values of many mutual funds, including to some extent the Fund. Conditions in the U.S. and many foreign economies have resulted, and may continue to result, in fixed income instruments experiencing unusual liquidity issues, increased price volatility and, in some cases, credit downgrades and increased likelihood of default. These events have reduced the willingness and ability of some lenders to extend credit, and have made it more difficult for borrowers to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all. As a result, the values of many types of debt securities have been reduced. In addition, global economies and financial markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, which increases the possibilities that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact issuers in a different country or region. The severity or duration of adverse economic conditions may also be affected by policy changes made by governments or quasi-governmental organizations. Because the situation in the markets is widespread, it may be difficult to identify both risks and opportunities using past models of the interplay of market forces, or to predict the duration of these market conditions. A decline in the Fund's average net assets during the current fiscal year due to market volatility or other factors could cause the Fund's expense ratios for the current fiscal year to be higher than the expense information presented in ""Fees and Expenses."" 5 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2013","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723620/000089843213000403/a497k-14.htm","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

While this analysis is inherently subjective and may be informed by internally generated and third-party metrics, data and other information, the Portfolio Managers believe that the consideration of financially material ESG factors, alongside traditional financial metrics, may improve credit analysis, security selection, relative value analysis and enhance the Fund's overall investment process. The specific ESG factors considered and scope and application of integration may vary depending on the specific 2 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 investment and/or investment type. The consideration of ESG factors does not apply to certain instruments, such as certain derivative instruments, other registered investment companies, cash and cash equivalents. The consideration of ESG factors as part of the investment process does not mean that the Fund pursues a specific ""impact"" or ""sustainable"" investment strategy. The teams will generally purchase securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is undervalued by the market and sell securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is overvalued by the market. The goal is to identify and evaluate investment opportunities that others may have missed.","Most of the Fund's performance depends on what happens in the market for debt instruments, the Portfolio Managers' evaluation of those developments, and the success of the Portfolio Managers in implementing the Fund's investment strategies. The Fund's use of derivative instruments will result in leverage, which amplifies the risks that are associated with these markets. The market's behavior can be difficult to predict, particularly in the short term. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its goal. The Fund may take temporary defensive and cash management positions; to the extent it does, it will not be pursuing its principal investment strategies. The actual risk exposure taken by the Fund in its investment program will vary over time, depending on various factors including the Portfolio Managers' evaluation of issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. There can be no guarantee that the Portfolio Managers will be successful in their attempts to manage the risk exposure of the Fund or will appropriately evaluate or weigh the multiple factors involved in investment decisions, including issuer, market and/or instrument-specific analysis, valuation and environmental, social and governance factors. The Fund is a mutual fund, not a bank deposit, and is not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. Each of the following risks, which are described in alphabetical order and not in order of any presumed importance, can significantly affect the Fund's performance. The relative importance of, or potential exposure as a result of, each of these risks will vary based on market and other investment-specific considerations. Call Risk. Upon the issuer's desire to call a security, or under other circumstances where a security is called, including when interest rates are low and issuers opt to repay the obligation underlying a ""callable security"" early, the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in an investment offering a lower yield and may not benefit from any increase in value that might otherwise result from declining interest rates. Commercial Paper Risk. Commercial paper is a short-term debt security issued by a corporation, bank, municipality, or other issuer. Issuers generally do not register their commercial paper with the SEC. While some unregistered commercial paper normally is deemed illiquid, the Manager may in certain cases determine that such paper is liquid. In some cases, the ratings of commercial paper issuers have been downgraded abruptly, leaving holders with little opportunity to avoid losses. Convertible Securities Risk. The value of a convertible security, which is a form of hybrid security (i.e., a security with both debt and equity characteristics), typically increases or decreases with the price of the underlying common stock. In general, a convertible security is subject to the market risks of stocks when the underlying stock's price is high relative to the conversion price and is subject to the market risks of debt securities when the underlying stock's price is low relative to the conversion price. The general market risks of debt securities that are common to convertible securities include, but are not limited to, interest rate risk and credit risk. Many convertible securities have credit ratings that are below investment grade and are subject to the same risks as an investment in lower-rated debt securities (commonly known as ""junk bonds""). To the extent the Fund invests in convertible securities issued by small- or mid-cap companies, it will be subject to the risks of investing in such companies. The securities of small- and mid-cap companies may fluctuate more widely in price than the market as a whole and there may also be less trading in small- or mid-cap securities. Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that issuers, guarantors, or insurers may fail, or become less able or unwilling, to pay interest and/or principal when due. Changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of an issuer or a downgrade or default affecting any of the Fund's securities could affect the Fund's performance by affecting the credit quality or value of the Fund's securities. Generally, the longer the maturity and the lower the credit quality of a security, the more sensitive it is to credit risk. Currency Risk. Currency risk is the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or other instruments denominated in or indexed to foreign currencies, changes in currency exchange rates could adversely impact investment gains or add to investment losses. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over 3 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 short periods of time and can be affected unpredictably by various factors, including investor perception and changes in interest rates; intervention, or failure to intervene, by U.S. or foreign governments, central banks, or supranational entities; or by currency controls or political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Derivatives Risk. Use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that can involve investment techniques and risks different from, and in some respects greater than, those associated with investing in more traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. Derivatives can be highly complex and highly volatile and may perform in unanticipated ways. Derivatives can create leverage, and the Fund could lose more than the amount it invests; some derivatives can have the potential for unlimited losses. Derivatives may at times be highly illiquid, and the Fund may not be able to close out or sell a derivative at a particular time or at an anticipated price. Derivatives can be difficult to value and valuation may be more difficult in times of market turmoil. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of the reference instrument underlying the derivative. There may be imperfect correlation between the behavior of a derivative and that of the reference instrument underlying the derivative. An abrupt change in the price of a reference instrument could render a derivative worthless. Derivatives may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the reference instrument. Suitable derivatives may not be available in all circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will use derivatives to reduce exposure to other risks when that might have been beneficial. Derivatives involve counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party to the derivative will fail to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the derivative. That risk is generally thought to be greater with over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives than with derivatives that are exchange traded or centrally cleared. When the Fund uses derivatives, it will likely be required to provide margin or collateral; these practices are intended to satisfy contractual undertakings and regulatory requirements and will not prevent the Fund from incurring losses on derivatives. The need to provide margin or collateral could limit the Fund's ability to pursue other opportunities as they arise. Ongoing changes to regulation of the derivatives markets and actual and potential changes in the regulation of funds using derivative instruments could limit the Fund's ability to pursue its investment strategies. New regulation of derivatives may make them more costly, or may otherwise adversely affect their liquidity, value or performance. Additional risks associated with certain types of derivatives are discussed below: Forward Contracts. There are no limitations on daily price movements of forward contracts. Changes in foreign exchange regulations by governmental authorities might limit the trading of forward contracts on currencies. Futures. Futures contracts are subject to the risk that an exchange may impose price fluctuation limits, which may make it difficult or impossible for a fund to close out a position when desired. In the absence of such limits, the liquidity of the futures market depends on participants entering into offsetting transactions rather than taking or making delivery. To the extent a Fund enters into futures contracts requiring physical delivery (e.g., certain commodities contracts), the inability of the Fund to take or make physical delivery can negatively impact performance. Swaps. The risk of loss with respect to swaps generally is limited to the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually obligated to make or, in the case of the other party to a swap defaulting, the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive. If the Fund sells a credit default swap, however, the risk of loss may be the entire notional amount of the swap. Some swaps are now executed through an organized exchange or regulated facility and cleared through a regulated clearing organization. The absence of an organized exchange or market for swap transactions may result in difficulties in trading and valuation, especially in the event of market disruptions. The use of an organized exchange or market for swap transactions is expected to result in swaps being easier to trade or value, but this may not always be the case. Foreign and Emerging Market Risk. Foreign securities, including those issued by foreign governments, involve risks in addition to those associated with comparable U.S. securities. Additional risks include exposure to less developed or less efficient trading markets; social, political, diplomatic, or economic instability; trade barriers and other protectionist trade policies (including those of the U.S.); imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals; significant government involvement in an economy and/or market structure; fluctuations in foreign currencies or currency redenomination; potential for default on sovereign debt; nationalization or expropriation of assets; settlement, custodial or other operational risks; higher transaction costs; confiscatory withholding or other taxes; and less stringent auditing and accounting, corporate disclosure, governance, and legal standards. As a result, foreign securities may fluctuate more widely in price, and may also be less liquid, than comparable U.S. securities. Regardless of where a company is organized or its stock is traded, its performance may be affected significantly by events in regions from which it derives its profits or in which it conducts significant operations. 4 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 Investing in emerging market countries involves risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign countries. The governments of emerging market countries may be more unstable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, intervene in the financial markets, and/or impose burdensome taxes that could adversely affect security prices. To the extent a foreign security is denominated in U.S. dollars, there is also the risk that a foreign government will not let U.S. dollar-denominated assets leave the country. In addition, the economies of emerging market countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Emerging market countries may also have less developed legal and accounting systems, and their legal systems may deal with issuer bankruptcies and defaults differently than U.S. law would. Securities markets in emerging market countries are also relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. Securities of issuers in emerging market countries may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of issuers in foreign countries with more developed economies or markets and the situation may require that the Fund fair value its holdings in those countries. Securities of issuers traded on foreign exchanges may be suspended, either by the issuers themselves, by an exchange, or by governmental authorities. The likelihood of such suspensions may be higher for securities of issuers in emerging or less-developed market countries than in countries with more developed markets. Trading suspensions may be applied from time to time to the securities of individual issuers for reasons specific to that issuer, or may be applied broadly by exchanges or governmental authorities in response to market events. Suspensions may last for significant periods of time, during which trading in the securities and in instruments that reference the securities, such as derivative instruments, may be halted. In the event that the Fund holds material positions in such suspended securities or instruments, the Fund's ability to liquidate its positions or provide liquidity to investors may be compromised and the Fund could incur significant losses. High Portfolio Turnover. The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading and may have a high portfolio turnover rate, which may increase the Fund's transaction costs, may adversely affect the Fund's performance and may generate a greater amount of capital gain distributions to shareholders than if the Fund had a low portfolio turnover rate. Inflation-Linked Debt Securities Risk. Inflation-linked debt securities are structured to provide protection against inflation. The value of the principal or the interest income paid on an inflation-linked debt security is adjusted to track changes in an official inflation measure. There can be no assurance that the inflation measure used will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and services. The value of inflation-linked debt securities is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates. Real interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. In general, the price of an inflation-linked debt security falls when real interest rates rise, and rises when real interest rates fall. Interest payments on inflation-linked debt securities will vary as the principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation and can be unpredictable. In periods of deflation, the Fund may have no income at all from such investments. The principal value of an investment in the Fund is not protected or otherwise guaranteed by virtue of the Fund's investments in inflation-linked debt securities. Interest Rate Risk. The Fund's yield and share price will fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates. In general, the value of investments with interest rate risk, such as debt securities, will move in the direction opposite to movements in interest rates. If interest rates rise, the value of such securities may decline. Typically, the longer the maturity or duration of a debt security, the greater the effect a change in interest rates could have on the security's price. Thus, the sensitivity of the Fund's debt securities to interest rate risk will increase with any increase in the duration of those securities. Inverse Floater Risk. An inverse floater earns interest at rates that vary inversely to changes in short-term interest rates. An inverse floater produces less income (and may produce no income) and may decline in value when market rates rise. An investment in an inverse floater may involve greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate security. Inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. An inverse floater may involve leverage, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile, increase interest rate risk and can magnify the Fund's losses. Issuer-Specific Risk. An individual security may be more volatile, and may perform differently, than the market as a whole. Leverage Risk. Leverage amplifies changes in the Fund's net asset value and may make the Fund more volatile. Derivatives and when-issued and forward-settling securities may create leverage and can result in losses to the Fund that exceed the amount originally invested and may accelerate the rate of losses. There can be no assurance that the Fund's use of any leverage will be successful. The Fund's investment exposure can exceed its net assets, sometimes by a significant amount. Liquidity Risk. From time to time, the trading market for a particular investment in which the Fund invests, or a particular type of instrument in which the Fund is invested, may become less liquid or even illiquid. Illiquid investments frequently can be more 5 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 difficult to purchase or sell at an advantageous price or time, and there is a greater risk that the investments may not be sold for the price at which the Fund is carrying them. Certain investments that were liquid when the Fund purchased them may become illiquid, sometimes abruptly. Additionally, market closures due to holidays or other factors may render a security or group of securities (e.g., securities tied to a particular country or geographic region) illiquid for a period of time. An inability to sell a portfolio position can adversely affect the Fund's value or prevent the Fund from being able to take advantage of other investment opportunities. Market prices for such securities or other investments may be volatile. During periods of substantial market volatility, an investment or even an entire market segment may become illiquid, sometimes abruptly, which can adversely affect the Fund's ability to limit losses. Unexpected episodes of illiquidity, including due to market or political factors, instrument or issuer-specific factors and/or unanticipated outflows, may limit the Fund's ability to pay redemption proceeds within the allowable time period. To meet redemption requests during periods of illiquidity, the Fund may be forced to sell securities at an unfavorable time and/or under unfavorable conditions. Loan Interests Risk. Loan interests generally are subject to restrictions on transfer, and the Fund may be unable to sell its loan interests at a time when it may otherwise be desirable to do so or may be able to sell them promptly only at prices that are less than what the Fund regards as their fair market value. Accordingly, loan interests may at times be illiquid. Loan interests may be difficult to value and may have extended settlement periods (the settlement cycle for many bank loans exceeds 7 days). Extended settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the Fund. As a result, during periods of unusually heavy redemptions, the Fund may have to sell other investments or borrow money to meet its obligations. A significant portion of floating rate loans may be ""covenant lite"" loans that may contain fewer or less restrictive constraints on the borrower and/or may contain other characteristics that would be favorable to the borrower, limiting the ability of lenders to take legal action to protect their interests in certain situations. Interests in loans made to finance highly leveraged companies or to finance corporate acquisitions or other transactions may be especially vulnerable to adverse changes in economic or market conditions. Interests in secured loans have the benefit of collateral and, typically, of restrictive covenants limiting the ability of the borrower to further encumber its assets. There is a risk that the value of any collateral securing a loan in which the Fund has an interest may decline and that the collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed on the loan. In the event the borrower defaults, the Fund's access to the collateral may be limited or delayed by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws. Further, in the event of a default, second or lower lien secured loans, and unsecured loans, will generally be paid only if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the borrower's obligations to the senior secured lenders, and the remaining collateral may not be sufficient to cover the full amount owed on the loan in which the Fund has an interest. Further, there is a risk that a court could take action with respect to a loan that is adverse to the holders of the loan and the Fund may need to retain legal counsel to enforce its rights in any resulting event of default, bankruptcy, or similar situation. Interests in loans expose the Fund to the credit risk of the underlying borrower and may expose the Fund to the credit risk of the lender. The Fund may acquire a loan interest by direct investment as a lender, by obtaining an assignment of all or a portion of the interests in a particular loan that are held by an original lender or a prior assignee or by participation in a loan interest that is held by another party. As an assignee, the Fund normally will succeed to all rights and obligations of its assignor with respect to the portion of the loan that is being assigned. However, the rights and obligations acquired by the purchaser of a loan assignment may differ from, and be more limited than, those held by the original lenders or the assignor. When the Fund's loan interest is a participation, the Fund may have less control over the exercise of remedies than the party selling the participation interest, and the Fund normally would not have any direct rights against the borrower. It is possible that the Fund could be held liable, or may be called upon to fulfill other obligations, with respect to loans in which it receives an assignment in whole or in part, or in which it owns a participation. The potential for such liability is greater for an assignee than for a participant. Lower-Rated Debt Securities Risk. Lower-rated debt securities (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and unrated debt securities determined to be of comparable quality involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities. Such securities may fluctuate more widely in price and yield and may fall in price during times when the economy is weak or is expected to become weak. These securities also may require a greater degree of judgment to establish a price and may be difficult to sell at the time and price the Fund desires. Lower-rated debt securities are considered by the major rating agencies to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to pay principal and interest and carry a greater risk that the issuer of such securities will default in the timely payment of principal and interest. Issuers of securities that are in default or have defaulted may fail to resume principal or interest payments, in which case the Fund may lose its entire investment. The creditworthiness of issuers of these securities may be more complex to analyze than that of issuers of investment grade debt securities, and the overreliance on credit ratings may present additional risks. 6 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 Market Volatility Risk. Markets may be volatile and values of individual securities and other investments, including those of a particular type, may decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments that may cause broad changes in market value, public perceptions concerning these developments, and adverse investor sentiment or publicity. Geopolitical and other risks, including environmental and public health risks may add to instability in world economies and markets generally. Changes in value may be temporary or may last for extended periods. If the Fund sells a portfolio position before it reaches its market peak, it may miss out on opportunities for better performance. Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. The value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage instruments, will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market or the assets underlying the securities. These securities tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than other types of debt securities. In addition, investments in mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be subject to prepayment risk and extension risk, call risk, credit risk, valuation risk, and illiquid investment risk, sometimes to a higher degree than various other types of debt securities. These securities are also subject to the risk of default on the underlying mortgages or assets, particularly during periods of market downturn, and an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the underlying assets will adversely affect the security's value. Municipal Securities Risk. The municipal securities market could be significantly affected by adverse political and legislative changes, as well as uncertainties related to taxation or the rights of municipal security holders. Changes in the financial health of a municipality or other issuer, or an insurer of municipal securities, may make it difficult for it to pay interest and principal when due and may affect the overall municipal securities market. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the municipal securities of a particular state or U.S. territory or possession, there is greater risk that political, regulatory, economic or other developments within that jurisdiction may have a significant impact on the Fund's investment performance. Declines in real estate prices and general business activity may reduce the tax revenues of state and local governments. Municipal issuers have on occasion defaulted on obligations, been downgraded, or commenced insolvency proceedings. Because many municipal securities are issued to finance similar types of projects, especially those related to education, health care, housing, transportation, and utilities, conditions in those sectors can affect the overall municipal securities market. Interest on municipal securities paid out of current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific asset (so-called ""private activity bonds"") are generally not backed by the creditworthiness or taxing authority of the issuing governmental entity; rather, a particular business or facility may be the only source of revenue supporting payment of interest and principal, and declines in general business activity could affect the economic viability of that business or facility. Municipal bonds may be bought or sold at a market discount (i.e., a price less than the bond's principal amount or, in the case of a bond issued with original issue discount (""OID""), a price less than the amount of the issue price plus accrued OID). If the market discount is more than a de minimis amount, and if the bond has a maturity date of more than one year from the date it was issued, then any market discount that accrues annually, or any gains earned on the disposition of the bond, generally will be subject to federal income taxation as ordinary (taxable) income rather than as capital gains. Some municipal securities, including those in the high yield market, may include transfer restrictions similar to restricted securities (e.g., may only be transferred to qualified institutional buyers and purchasers meeting other qualification requirements set by the issuer). As such, it may be difficult to sell municipal securities at a time when it may otherwise be desirable to do so or the Fund may be able to sell them only at prices that are less than what the Fund regards as their fair market value. Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities, which are a form of hybrid security (i.e., a security with both debt and equity characteristics), may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities, however, unlike common stocks, participation in the growth of an issuer may be limited. Distributions on preferred securities are generally payable at the discretion of the issuer's board of directors and after the company makes required payments to holders of its debt securities. For this reason, preferred securities are subject to greater credit, interest, and liquidation risk than debt securities, and the value of preferred securities will usually react more strongly than debt securities to actual or perceived changes in the company's financial condition or prospects. Preferred securities of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred securities of larger companies. Preferred securities may be less liquid than common stocks. Prepayment and Extension Risk.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723620/000120677423000259/nb4155131-497k.htm","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

The Fund may invest in a broad array of securities, including: securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities; inflation-linked debt securities; municipal securities; foreign securities, including emerging markets; corporate bonds; commercial paper; mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities; and loans. Securities in which the Fund may invest may be issued by domestic and foreign governments, supranational entities (e.g. World Bank, IMF), corporate entities and trusts and may be structured as fixed rate debt; floating rate debt; and debt that may not pay interest from the time of issuance. While the Fund may invest in debt securities across the credit spectrum, including investment grade securities, below investment grade securities and unrated securities, and may invest without limit in below investment grade securities (commonly known as NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 ""junk bonds""), under normal market conditions, the Portfolio Managers anticipate that the Fund's average credit quality will be investment grade. The Fund considers debt securities to be below investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories by at least one independent credit rating agency or, if unrated, are determined by the Portfolio Managers to be of comparable quality. The Fund does not normally invest in or continue to hold securities that are in default or have defaulted with respect to the payment of interest or repayment of principal, but may do so depending on market or other conditions. The Fund may invest in or continue to hold securities that the Portfolio Managers believe have ratings or other factors that imply an imminent risk of default with respect to such payments. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments as a means of hedging risk and/or for investment or efficient portfolio management purposes, which may include altering the Fund's exposure to currencies, interest rates, inflation, sectors and individual issuers. These derivative instruments may include futures, forwards, including forward foreign currency contracts, and swaps, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps, options on futures and options on interest rate swaps, otherwise known as swaptions. The Fund may also invest without limit in foreign securities, which may be denominated in any currency including the local currency of the issuer, but normally will not invest more than 50% of its total assets at the time of investment in obligations of issuers in emerging market countries. The Fund considers emerging market countries to be countries included in the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index - Global Diversified, the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index - Diversified, the JPMorgan Emerging Local Markets Index or the JPMorgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified, as well as those countries which are not defined as a High Income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country by the World Bank. Additionally, the Fund may invest in tender option bonds (which include inverse floaters created as part of tender option bond transactions), convertible securities, restricted securities and preferred securities. The Fund may also engage in when-issued and forward-settling securities (such as to-be-announced (""TBA"") mortgage-backed securities), which involve a commitment by the Fund to purchase securities that will be issued or settled at a later date. The Fund may enter into a TBA agreement and ""roll over"" such agreement prior to the settlement date by selling the obligation to purchase the securities set forth in the agreement and entering into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of mortgage-backed securities. The Fund may also hold cash and short-term securities, including cash equivalents and other debt obligations. The Fund may invest in debt securities of any maturity and while the Fund does not have a target average duration, under normal market conditions, the Portfolio Managers anticipate that the Fund's average duration will be between two and eight years. In an effort to achieve its goal, the Fund may engage in active and frequent trading. Investment Philosophy and Process The Portfolio Management Team's investment philosophy is rooted in the belief that positive results can be achieved through a consistently applied, risk-managed approach to portfolio management that leverages the strengths of its proprietary fundamental research capabilities, decision-making frameworks, and quantitative risk management tools. The Portfolio Management Team employs an integrated investment process in managing the Fund. ■ Portfolio Strategy: The Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, which it monitors on an ongoing basis, including exposures to sectors (such as government, structured debt, credit, etc.) and duration/yield curve positioning, utilizing internally generated data that are produced by specialty sector investment teams in conjunction with asset allocation tools. ■ Strategy Implementation: Once the Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, the specialty sector investment teams and the Portfolio Management Team determine industry/sub-sector weightings and make securities selections within the types of securities that the Fund can purchase, such as investment grade securities, below investment grade securities, emerging market securities and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. When assessing the worth of a particular security, the teams utilize internally generated research and proprietary quantitatively driven tools and frameworks (including an analysis of cash flows, ability to pay principal and interest, balance sheet composition, and market positioning) to a) establish an internal outlook, b) evaluate the market's outlook as it is reflected in asset prices, and c) contrast the two. As part of their fundamental investment analysis the Portfolio Managers consider Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors they believe are financially material to individual investments, where applicable, as described below. While this analysis is inherently subjective and may be informed by internally generated and third-party metrics, data and other information, the Portfolio Managers believe that the consideration of financially material ESG factors, alongside traditional financial metrics, may improve credit analysis, security selection, relative value analysis and enhance the Fund's overall investment process. The specific ESG factors considered and scope and application of integration may vary depending on the specific 2 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 investment and/or investment type. The consideration of ESG factors does not apply to certain instruments, such as certain derivative instruments, other registered investment companies, cash and cash equivalents. The consideration of ESG factors as part of the investment process does not mean that the Fund pursues a specific ""impact"" or ""sustainable"" investment strategy. The teams will generally purchase securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is undervalued by the market and sell securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is overvalued by the market. The goal is to identify and evaluate investment opportunities that others may have missed.","Most of the Fund's performance depends on what happens in the market for debt instruments, the Portfolio Managers' evaluation of those developments, and the success of the Portfolio Managers in implementing the Fund's investment strategies. The Fund's use of derivative instruments will result in leverage, which amplifies the risks that are associated with these markets. The market's behavior can be difficult to predict, particularly in the short term. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its goal. The Fund may take temporary defensive and cash management positions; to the extent it does, it will not be pursuing its principal investment strategies. The actual risk exposure taken by the Fund in its investment program will vary over time, depending on various factors including the Portfolio Managers' evaluation of issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. There can be no guarantee that the Portfolio Managers will be successful in their attempts to manage the risk exposure of the Fund or will appropriately evaluate or weigh the multiple factors involved in investment decisions, including issuer, market and/or instrument-specific analysis, valuation and environmental, social and governance factors. The Fund is a mutual fund, not a bank deposit, and is not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. Each of the following risks, which are described in alphabetical order and not in order of any presumed importance, can significantly affect the Fund's performance. The relative importance of, or potential exposure as a result of, each of these risks will vary based on market and other investment-specific considerations. Call Risk. Upon the issuer's desire to call a security, or under other circumstances where a security is called, including when interest rates are low and issuers opt to repay the obligation underlying a ""callable security"" early, the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in an investment offering a lower yield and may not benefit from any increase in value that might otherwise result from declining interest rates. Commercial Paper Risk. Commercial paper is a short-term debt security issued by a corporation, bank, municipality, or other issuer. Issuers generally do not register their commercial paper with the SEC. While some unregistered commercial paper normally is deemed illiquid, the Manager may in certain cases determine that such paper is liquid. In some cases, the ratings of commercial paper issuers have been downgraded abruptly, leaving holders with little opportunity to avoid losses. Convertible Securities Risk. The value of a convertible security, which is a form of hybrid security (i.e., a security with both debt and equity characteristics), typically increases or decreases with the price of the underlying common stock. In general, a convertible security is subject to the market risks of stocks when the underlying stock's price is high relative to the conversion price and is subject to the market risks of debt securities when the underlying stock's price is low relative to the conversion price. The general market risks of debt securities that are common to convertible securities include, but are not limited to, interest rate risk and credit risk. Many convertible securities have credit ratings that are below investment grade and are subject to the same risks as an investment in lower-rated debt securities (commonly known as ""junk bonds""). To the extent the Fund invests in convertible securities issued by small- or mid-cap companies, it will be subject to the risks of investing in such companies. The securities of small- and mid-cap companies may fluctuate more widely in price than the market as a whole and there may also be less trading in small- or mid-cap securities. Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that issuers, guarantors, or insurers may fail, or become less able or unwilling, to pay interest and/or principal when due. Changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of an issuer or a downgrade or default affecting any of the Fund's securities could affect the Fund's performance by affecting the credit quality or value of the Fund's securities. Generally, the longer the maturity and the lower the credit quality of a security, the more sensitive it is to credit risk. Currency Risk. Currency risk is the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or other instruments denominated in or indexed to foreign currencies, changes in currency exchange rates could adversely impact investment gains or add to investment losses. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over 3 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 short periods of time and can be affected unpredictably by various factors, including investor perception and changes in interest rates; intervention, or failure to intervene, by U.S. or foreign governments, central banks, or supranational entities; or by currency controls or political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Derivatives Risk. Use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that can involve investment techniques and risks different from, and in some respects greater than, those associated with investing in more traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. Derivatives can be highly complex and highly volatile and may perform in unanticipated ways. Derivatives can create leverage, and the Fund could lose more than the amount it invests; some derivatives can have the potential for unlimited losses. Derivatives may at times be highly illiquid, and the Fund may not be able to close out or sell a derivative at a particular time or at an anticipated price. Derivatives can be difficult to value and valuation may be more difficult in times of market turmoil. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of the reference instrument underlying the derivative. There may be imperfect correlation between the behavior of a derivative and that of the reference instrument underlying the derivative. An abrupt change in the price of a reference instrument could render a derivative worthless. Derivatives may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the reference instrument. Suitable derivatives may not be available in all circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will use derivatives to reduce exposure to other risks when that might have been beneficial. Derivatives involve counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party to the derivative will fail to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the derivative. That risk is generally thought to be greater with over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives than with derivatives that are exchange traded or centrally cleared. When the Fund uses derivatives, it will likely be required to provide margin or collateral; these practices are intended to satisfy contractual undertakings and regulatory requirements and will not prevent the Fund from incurring losses on derivatives. The need to provide margin or collateral could limit the Fund's ability to pursue other opportunities as they arise. Ongoing changes to regulation of the derivatives markets and actual and potential changes in the regulation of funds using derivative instruments could limit the Fund's ability to pursue its investment strategies. New regulation of derivatives may make them more costly, or may otherwise adversely affect their liquidity, value or performance. Additional risks associated with certain types of derivatives are discussed below: Forward Contracts. There are no limitations on daily price movements of forward contracts. Changes in foreign exchange regulations by governmental authorities might limit the trading of forward contracts on currencies. Futures. Futures contracts are subject to the risk that an exchange may impose price fluctuation limits, which may make it difficult or impossible for a fund to close out a position when desired. In the absence of such limits, the liquidity of the futures market depends on participants entering into offsetting transactions rather than taking or making delivery. To the extent a Fund enters into futures contracts requiring physical delivery (e.g., certain commodities contracts), the inability of the Fund to take or make physical delivery can negatively impact performance. Swaps. The risk of loss with respect to swaps generally is limited to the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually obligated to make or, in the case of the other party to a swap defaulting, the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive. If the Fund sells a credit default swap, however, the risk of loss may be the entire notional amount of the swap. Some swaps are now executed through an organized exchange or regulated facility and cleared through a regulated clearing organization. The absence of an organized exchange or market for swap transactions may result in difficulties in trading and valuation, especially in the event of market disruptions. The use of an organized exchange or market for swap transactions is expected to result in swaps being easier to trade or value, but this may not always be the case. Foreign and Emerging Market Risk. Foreign securities, including those issued by foreign governments, involve risks in addition to those associated with comparable U.S. securities. Additional risks include exposure to less developed or less efficient trading markets; social, political, diplomatic, or economic instability; trade barriers and other protectionist trade policies (including those of the U.S.); imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals; significant government involvement in an economy and/or market structure; fluctuations in foreign currencies or currency redenomination; potential for default on sovereign debt; nationalization or expropriation of assets; settlement, custodial or other operational risks; higher transaction costs; confiscatory withholding or other taxes; and less stringent auditing and accounting, corporate disclosure, governance, and legal standards. As a result, foreign securities may fluctuate more widely in price, and may also be less liquid, than comparable U.S. securities. Regardless of where a company is organized or its stock is traded, its performance may be affected significantly by events in regions from which it derives its profits or in which it conducts significant operations. 4 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 Investing in emerging market countries involves risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign countries. The governments of emerging market countries may be more unstable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, intervene in the financial markets, and/or impose burdensome taxes that could adversely affect security prices. To the extent a foreign security is denominated in U.S. dollars, there is also the risk that a foreign government will not let U.S. dollar-denominated assets leave the country. In addition, the economies of emerging market countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Emerging market countries may also have less developed legal and accounting systems, and their legal systems may deal with issuer bankruptcies and defaults differently than U.S. law would. Securities markets in emerging market countries are also relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. Securities of issuers in emerging market countries may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of issuers in foreign countries with more developed economies or markets and the situation may require that the Fund fair value its holdings in those countries. Securities of issuers traded on foreign exchanges may be suspended, either by the issuers themselves, by an exchange, or by governmental authorities. The likelihood of such suspensions may be higher for securities of issuers in emerging or less-developed market countries than in countries with more developed markets. Trading suspensions may be applied from time to time to the securities of individual issuers for reasons specific to that issuer, or may be applied broadly by exchanges or governmental authorities in response to market events. Suspensions may last for significant periods of time, during which trading in the securities and in instruments that reference the securities, such as derivative instruments, may be halted. In the event that the Fund holds material positions in such suspended securities or instruments, the Fund's ability to liquidate its positions or provide liquidity to investors may be compromised and the Fund could incur significant losses. High Portfolio Turnover. The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading and may have a high portfolio turnover rate, which may increase the Fund's transaction costs, may adversely affect the Fund's performance and may generate a greater amount of capital gain distributions to shareholders than if the Fund had a low portfolio turnover rate. Inflation-Linked Debt Securities Risk. Inflation-linked debt securities are structured to provide protection against inflation. The value of the principal or the interest income paid on an inflation-linked debt security is adjusted to track changes in an official inflation measure. There can be no assurance that the inflation measure used will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and services. The value of inflation-linked debt securities is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates. Real interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. In general, the price of an inflation-linked debt security falls when real interest rates rise, and rises when real interest rates fall. Interest payments on inflation-linked debt securities will vary as the principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation and can be unpredictable. In periods of deflation, the Fund may have no income at all from such investments. The principal value of an investment in the Fund is not protected or otherwise guaranteed by virtue of the Fund's investments in inflation-linked debt securities. Interest Rate Risk. The Fund's yield and share price will fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates. In general, the value of investments with interest rate risk, such as debt securities, will move in the direction opposite to movements in interest rates. If interest rates rise, the value of such securities may decline. Typically, the longer the maturity or duration of a debt security, the greater the effect a change in interest rates could have on the security's price. Thus, the sensitivity of the Fund's debt securities to interest rate risk will increase with any increase in the duration of those securities. Inverse Floater Risk. An inverse floater earns interest at rates that vary inversely to changes in short-term interest rates. An inverse floater produces less income (and may produce no income) and may decline in value when market rates rise. An investment in an inverse floater may involve greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate security. Inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. An inverse floater may involve leverage, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile, increase interest rate risk and can magnify the Fund's losses. Issuer-Specific Risk. An individual security may be more volatile, and may perform differently, than the market as a whole. Leverage Risk. Leverage amplifies changes in the Fund's net asset value and may make the Fund more volatile. Derivatives and when-issued and forward-settling securities may create leverage and can result in losses to the Fund that exceed the amount originally invested and may accelerate the rate of losses. There can be no assurance that the Fund's use of any leverage will be successful. The Fund's investment exposure can exceed its net assets, sometimes by a significant amount. Liquidity Risk. From time to time, the trading market for a particular investment in which the Fund invests, or a particular type of instrument in which the Fund is invested, may become less liquid or even illiquid. Illiquid investments frequently can be more 5 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 difficult to purchase or sell at an advantageous price or time, and there is a greater risk that the investments may not be sold for the price at which the Fund is carrying them. Certain investments that were liquid when the Fund purchased them may become illiquid, sometimes abruptly. Additionally, market closures due to holidays or other factors may render a security or group of securities (e.g., securities tied to a particular country or geographic region) illiquid for a period of time. An inability to sell a portfolio position can adversely affect the Fund's value or prevent the Fund from being able to take advantage of other investment opportunities. Market prices for such securities or other investments may be volatile. During periods of substantial market volatility, an investment or even an entire market segment may become illiquid, sometimes abruptly, which can adversely affect the Fund's ability to limit losses. Unexpected episodes of illiquidity, including due to market or political factors, instrument or issuer-specific factors and/or unanticipated outflows, may limit the Fund's ability to pay redemption proceeds within the allowable time period. To meet redemption requests during periods of illiquidity, the Fund may be forced to sell securities at an unfavorable time and/or under unfavorable conditions. Loan Interests Risk. Loan interests generally are subject to restrictions on transfer, and the Fund may be unable to sell its loan interests at a time when it may otherwise be desirable to do so or may be able to sell them promptly only at prices that are less than what the Fund regards as their fair market value. Accordingly, loan interests may at times be illiquid. Loan interests may be difficult to value and may have extended settlement periods (the settlement cycle for many bank loans exceeds 7 days). Extended settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the Fund. As a result, during periods of unusually heavy redemptions, the Fund may have to sell other investments or borrow money to meet its obligations. A significant portion of floating rate loans may be ""covenant lite"" loans that may contain fewer or less restrictive constraints on the borrower and/or may contain other characteristics that would be favorable to the borrower, limiting the ability of lenders to take legal action to protect their interests in certain situations. Interests in loans made to finance highly leveraged companies or to finance corporate acquisitions or other transactions may be especially vulnerable to adverse changes in economic or market conditions. Interests in secured loans have the benefit of collateral and, typically, of restrictive covenants limiting the ability of the borrower to further encumber its assets. There is a risk that the value of any collateral securing a loan in which the Fund has an interest may decline and that the collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed on the loan. In the event the borrower defaults, the Fund's access to the collateral may be limited or delayed by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws. Further, in the event of a default, second or lower lien secured loans, and unsecured loans, will generally be paid only if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the borrower's obligations to the senior secured lenders, and the remaining collateral may not be sufficient to cover the full amount owed on the loan in which the Fund has an interest. Further, there is a risk that a court could take action with respect to a loan that is adverse to the holders of the loan and the Fund may need to retain legal counsel to enforce its rights in any resulting event of default, bankruptcy, or similar situation. Interests in loans expose the Fund to the credit risk of the underlying borrower and may expose the Fund to the credit risk of the lender. The Fund may acquire a loan interest by direct investment as a lender, by obtaining an assignment of all or a portion of the interests in a particular loan that are held by an original lender or a prior assignee or by participation in a loan interest that is held by another party. As an assignee, the Fund normally will succeed to all rights and obligations of its assignor with respect to the portion of the loan that is being assigned. However, the rights and obligations acquired by the purchaser of a loan assignment may differ from, and be more limited than, those held by the original lenders or the assignor. When the Fund's loan interest is a participation, the Fund may have less control over the exercise of remedies than the party selling the participation interest, and the Fund normally would not have any direct rights against the borrower. It is possible that the Fund could be held liable, or may be called upon to fulfill other obligations, with respect to loans in which it receives an assignment in whole or in part, or in which it owns a participation. The potential for such liability is greater for an assignee than for a participant. Lower-Rated Debt Securities Risk. Lower-rated debt securities (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and unrated debt securities determined to be of comparable quality involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities. Such securities may fluctuate more widely in price and yield and may fall in price during times when the economy is weak or is expected to become weak. These securities also may require a greater degree of judgment to establish a price and may be difficult to sell at the time and price the Fund desires. Lower-rated debt securities are considered by the major rating agencies to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to pay principal and interest and carry a greater risk that the issuer of such securities will default in the timely payment of principal and interest. Issuers of securities that are in default or have defaulted may fail to resume principal or interest payments, in which case the Fund may lose its entire investment. The creditworthiness of issuers of these securities may be more complex to analyze than that of issuers of investment grade debt securities, and the overreliance on credit ratings may present additional risks. 6 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 Market Volatility Risk. Markets may be volatile and values of individual securities and other investments, including those of a particular type, may decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments that may cause broad changes in market value, public perceptions concerning these developments, and adverse investor sentiment or publicity. Geopolitical and other risks, including environmental and public health risks may add to instability in world economies and markets generally. Changes in value may be temporary or may last for extended periods. If the Fund sells a portfolio position before it reaches its market peak, it may miss out on opportunities for better performance. Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. The value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage instruments, will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market or the assets underlying the securities. These securities tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than other types of debt securities. In addition, investments in mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be subject to prepayment risk and extension risk, call risk, credit risk, valuation risk, and illiquid investment risk, sometimes to a higher degree than various other types of debt securities. These securities are also subject to the risk of default on the underlying mortgages or assets, particularly during periods of market downturn, and an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the underlying assets will adversely affect the security's value. Municipal Securities Risk. The municipal securities market could be significantly affected by adverse political and legislative changes, as well as uncertainties related to taxation or the rights of municipal security holders. Changes in the financial health of a municipality or other issuer, or an insurer of municipal securities, may make it difficult for it to pay interest and principal when due and may affect the overall municipal securities market. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the municipal securities of a particular state or U.S. territory or possession, there is greater risk that political, regulatory, economic or other developments within that jurisdiction may have a significant impact on the Fund's investment performance. Declines in real estate prices and general business activity may reduce the tax revenues of state and local governments. Municipal issuers have on occasion defaulted on obligations, been downgraded, or commenced insolvency proceedings. Because many municipal securities are issued to finance similar types of projects, especially those related to education, health care, housing, transportation, and utilities, conditions in those sectors can affect the overall municipal securities market. Interest on municipal securities paid out of current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific asset (so-called ""private activity bonds"") are generally not backed by the creditworthiness or taxing authority of the issuing governmental entity; rather, a particular business or facility may be the only source of revenue supporting payment of interest and principal, and declines in general business activity could affect the economic viability of that business or facility. Municipal bonds may be bought or sold at a market discount (i.e., a price less than the bond's principal amount or, in the case of a bond issued with original issue discount (""OID""), a price less than the amount of the issue price plus accrued OID). If the market discount is more than a de minimis amount, and if the bond has a maturity date of more than one year from the date it was issued, then any market discount that accrues annually, or any gains earned on the disposition of the bond, generally will be subject to federal income taxation as ordinary (taxable) income rather than as capital gains. Some municipal securities, including those in the high yield market, may include transfer restrictions similar to restricted securities (e.g., may only be transferred to qualified institutional buyers and purchasers meeting other qualification requirements set by the issuer). As such, it may be difficult to sell municipal securities at a time when it may otherwise be desirable to do so or the Fund may be able to sell them only at prices that are less than what the Fund regards as their fair market value. Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities, which are a form of hybrid security (i.e., a security with both debt and equity characteristics), may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities, however, unlike common stocks, participation in the growth of an issuer may be limited. Distributions on preferred securities are generally payable at the discretion of the issuer's board of directors and after the company makes required payments to holders of its debt securities. For this reason, preferred securities are subject to greater credit, interest, and liquidation risk than debt securities, and the value of preferred securities will usually react more strongly than debt securities to actual or perceived changes in the company's financial condition or prospects. Preferred securities of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred securities of larger companies. Preferred securities may be less liquid than common stocks. Prepayment and Extension Risk.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723620/000120677423000260/nb4155141-497k.htm","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"
"4","FSUSA06UAT","FOUSA05HD8","NSTLX","S000007834","2023-02-27","The Fund seeks high current income with a secondary objective of long-term capital appreciation.","To pursue its goal, the Fund invests primarily in a diversified mix of debt securities. The Fund may invest in a broad array of securities, including: securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities; inflation-linked debt securities; municipal securities; foreign securities, including emerging markets; corporate bonds; commercial paper; mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities; and loans. Securities in which the Fund may invest may be issued by domestic and foreign governments, supranational entities (e.g. World Bank, IMF), corporate entities and trusts and may be structured as fixed rate debt; floating rate debt; and debt that may not pay interest from the time of issuance. While the Fund may invest in debt securities across the credit spectrum, including investment grade securities, below investment grade securities and unrated securities, and may invest without limit in below investment grade securities (commonly known as NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 ""junk bonds""), under normal market conditions, the Portfolio Managers anticipate that the Fund's average credit quality will be investment grade. The Fund considers debt securities to be below investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories by at least one independent credit rating agency or, if unrated, are determined by the Portfolio Managers to be of comparable quality. The Fund does not normally invest in or continue to hold securities that are in default or have defaulted with respect to the payment of interest or repayment of principal, but may do so depending on market or other conditions. The Fund may invest in or continue to hold securities that the Portfolio Managers believe have ratings or other factors that imply an imminent risk of default with respect to such payments. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments as a means of hedging risk and/or for investment or efficient portfolio management purposes, which may include altering the Fund's exposure to currencies, interest rates, inflation, sectors and individual issuers. These derivative instruments may include futures, forwards, including forward foreign currency contracts, and swaps, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps, options on futures and options on interest rate swaps, otherwise known as swaptions. The Fund may also invest without limit in foreign securities, which may be denominated in any currency including the local currency of the issuer, but normally will not invest more than 50% of its total assets at the time of investment in obligations of issuers in emerging market countries. The Fund considers emerging market countries to be countries included in the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index - Global Diversified, the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index - Diversified, the JPMorgan Emerging Local Markets Index or the JPMorgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified, as well as those countries which are not defined as a High Income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country by the World Bank. Additionally, the Fund may invest in tender option bonds (which include inverse floaters created as part of tender option bond transactions), convertible securities, restricted securities and preferred securities. The Fund may also engage in when-issued and forward-settling securities (such as to-be-announced (""TBA"") mortgage-backed securities), which involve a commitment by the Fund to purchase securities that will be issued or settled at a later date. The Fund may enter into a TBA agreement and ""roll over"" such agreement prior to the settlement date by selling the obligation to purchase the securities set forth in the agreement and entering into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of mortgage-backed securities. The Fund may also hold cash and short-term securities, including cash equivalents and other debt obligations. The Fund may invest in debt securities of any maturity and while the Fund does not have a target average duration, under normal market conditions, the Portfolio Managers anticipate that the Fund's average duration will be between two and eight years. In an effort to achieve its goal, the Fund may engage in active and frequent trading. Investment Philosophy and Process The Portfolio Management Team's investment philosophy is rooted in the belief that positive results can be achieved through a consistently applied, risk-managed approach to portfolio management that leverages the strengths of its proprietary fundamental research capabilities, decision-making frameworks, and quantitative risk management tools. The Portfolio Management Team employs an integrated investment process in managing the Fund. ■ Portfolio Strategy: The Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, which it monitors on an ongoing basis, including exposures to sectors (such as government, structured debt, credit, etc.) and duration/yield curve positioning, utilizing internally generated data that are produced by specialty sector investment teams in conjunction with asset allocation tools. ■ Strategy Implementation: Once the Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, the specialty sector investment teams and the Portfolio Management Team determine industry/sub-sector weightings and make securities selections within the types of securities that the Fund can purchase, such as investment grade securities, below investment grade securities, emerging market securities and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. When assessing the worth of a particular security, the teams utilize internally generated research and proprietary quantitatively driven tools and frameworks (including an analysis of cash flows, ability to pay principal and interest, balance sheet composition, and market positioning) to a) establish an internal outlook, b) evaluate the market's outlook as it is reflected in asset prices, and c) contrast the two. As part of their fundamental investment analysis the Portfolio Managers consider Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors they believe are financially material to individual investments, where applicable, as described below. While this analysis is inherently subjective and may be informed by internally generated and third-party metrics, data and other information, the Portfolio Managers believe that the consideration of financially material ESG factors, alongside traditional financial metrics, may improve credit analysis, security selection, relative value analysis and enhance the Fund's overall investment process. The specific ESG factors considered and scope and application of integration may vary depending on the specific 2 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 investment and/or investment type. The consideration of ESG factors does not apply to certain instruments, such as certain derivative instruments, other registered investment companies, cash and cash equivalents. The consideration of ESG factors as part of the investment process does not mean that the Fund pursues a specific ""impact"" or ""sustainable"" investment strategy. The teams will generally purchase securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is undervalued by the market and sell securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is overvalued by the market. The goal is to identify and evaluate investment opportunities that others may have missed.","Most of the Fund's performance depends on what happens in the market for debt instruments, the Portfolio Managers' evaluation of those developments, and the success of the Portfolio Managers in implementing the Fund's investment strategies. The Fund's use of derivative instruments will result in leverage, which amplifies the risks that are associated with these markets. The market's behavior can be difficult to predict, particularly in the short term. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its goal. The Fund may take temporary defensive and cash management positions; to the extent it does, it will not be pursuing its principal investment strategies. The actual risk exposure taken by the Fund in its investment program will vary over time, depending on various factors including the Portfolio Managers' evaluation of issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. There can be no guarantee that the Portfolio Managers will be successful in their attempts to manage the risk exposure of the Fund or will appropriately evaluate or weigh the multiple factors involved in investment decisions, including issuer, market and/or instrument-specific analysis, valuation and environmental, social and governance factors. The Fund is a mutual fund, not a bank deposit, and is not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. Each of the following risks, which are described in alphabetical order and not in order of any presumed importance, can significantly affect the Fund's performance. The relative importance of, or potential exposure as a result of, each of these risks will vary based on market and other investment-specific considerations. Call Risk. Upon the issuer's desire to call a security, or under other circumstances where a security is called, including when interest rates are low and issuers opt to repay the obligation underlying a ""callable security"" early, the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in an investment offering a lower yield and may not benefit from any increase in value that might otherwise result from declining interest rates. Commercial Paper Risk. Commercial paper is a short-term debt security issued by a corporation, bank, municipality, or other issuer. Issuers generally do not register their commercial paper with the SEC. While some unregistered commercial paper normally is deemed illiquid, the Manager may in certain cases determine that such paper is liquid. In some cases, the ratings of commercial paper issuers have been downgraded abruptly, leaving holders with little opportunity to avoid losses. Convertible Securities Risk. The value of a convertible security, which is a form of hybrid security (i.e., a security with both debt and equity characteristics), typically increases or decreases with the price of the underlying common stock. In general, a convertible security is subject to the market risks of stocks when the underlying stock's price is high relative to the conversion price and is subject to the market risks of debt securities when the underlying stock's price is low relative to the conversion price. The general market risks of debt securities that are common to convertible securities include, but are not limited to, interest rate risk and credit risk. Many convertible securities have credit ratings that are below investment grade and are subject to the same risks as an investment in lower-rated debt securities (commonly known as ""junk bonds""). To the extent the Fund invests in convertible securities issued by small- or mid-cap companies, it will be subject to the risks of investing in such companies. The securities of small- and mid-cap companies may fluctuate more widely in price than the market as a whole and there may also be less trading in small- or mid-cap securities. Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that issuers, guarantors, or insurers may fail, or become less able or unwilling, to pay interest and/or principal when due. Changes in the actual or perceived creditworthiness of an issuer or a downgrade or default affecting any of the Fund's securities could affect the Fund's performance by affecting the credit quality or value of the Fund's securities. Generally, the longer the maturity and the lower the credit quality of a security, the more sensitive it is to credit risk. Currency Risk. Currency risk is the risk that foreign currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or other instruments denominated in or indexed to foreign currencies, changes in currency exchange rates could adversely impact investment gains or add to investment losses. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over 3 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 short periods of time and can be affected unpredictably by various factors, including investor perception and changes in interest rates; intervention, or failure to intervene, by U.S. or foreign governments, central banks, or supranational entities; or by currency controls or political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Derivatives Risk. Use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that can involve investment techniques and risks different from, and in some respects greater than, those associated with investing in more traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. Derivatives can be highly complex and highly volatile and may perform in unanticipated ways. Derivatives can create leverage, and the Fund could lose more than the amount it invests; some derivatives can have the potential for unlimited losses. Derivatives may at times be highly illiquid, and the Fund may not be able to close out or sell a derivative at a particular time or at an anticipated price. Derivatives can be difficult to value and valuation may be more difficult in times of market turmoil. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of the reference instrument underlying the derivative. There may be imperfect correlation between the behavior of a derivative and that of the reference instrument underlying the derivative. An abrupt change in the price of a reference instrument could render a derivative worthless. Derivatives may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the reference instrument. Suitable derivatives may not be available in all circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will use derivatives to reduce exposure to other risks when that might have been beneficial. Derivatives involve counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party to the derivative will fail to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the derivative. That risk is generally thought to be greater with over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives than with derivatives that are exchange traded or centrally cleared. When the Fund uses derivatives, it will likely be required to provide margin or collateral; these practices are intended to satisfy contractual undertakings and regulatory requirements and will not prevent the Fund from incurring losses on derivatives. The need to provide margin or collateral could limit the Fund's ability to pursue other opportunities as they arise. Ongoing changes to regulation of the derivatives markets and actual and potential changes in the regulation of funds using derivative instruments could limit the Fund's ability to pursue its investment strategies. New regulation of derivatives may make them more costly, or may otherwise adversely affect their liquidity, value or performance. Additional risks associated with certain types of derivatives are discussed below: Forward Contracts. There are no limitations on daily price movements of forward contracts. Changes in foreign exchange regulations by governmental authorities might limit the trading of forward contracts on currencies. Futures. Futures contracts are subject to the risk that an exchange may impose price fluctuation limits, which may make it difficult or impossible for a fund to close out a position when desired. In the absence of such limits, the liquidity of the futures market depends on participants entering into offsetting transactions rather than taking or making delivery. To the extent a Fund enters into futures contracts requiring physical delivery (e.g., certain commodities contracts), the inability of the Fund to take or make physical delivery can negatively impact performance. Swaps. The risk of loss with respect to swaps generally is limited to the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually obligated to make or, in the case of the other party to a swap defaulting, the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive. If the Fund sells a credit default swap, however, the risk of loss may be the entire notional amount of the swap. Some swaps are now executed through an organized exchange or regulated facility and cleared through a regulated clearing organization. The absence of an organized exchange or market for swap transactions may result in difficulties in trading and valuation, especially in the event of market disruptions. The use of an organized exchange or market for swap transactions is expected to result in swaps being easier to trade or value, but this may not always be the case. Foreign and Emerging Market Risk. Foreign securities, including those issued by foreign governments, involve risks in addition to those associated with comparable U.S. securities. Additional risks include exposure to less developed or less efficient trading markets; social, political, diplomatic, or economic instability; trade barriers and other protectionist trade policies (including those of the U.S.); imposition of economic sanctions against a particular country or countries, organizations, companies, entities and/or individuals; significant government involvement in an economy and/or market structure; fluctuations in foreign currencies or currency redenomination; potential for default on sovereign debt; nationalization or expropriation of assets; settlement, custodial or other operational risks; higher transaction costs; confiscatory withholding or other taxes; and less stringent auditing and accounting, corporate disclosure, governance, and legal standards. As a result, foreign securities may fluctuate more widely in price, and may also be less liquid, than comparable U.S. securities. Regardless of where a company is organized or its stock is traded, its performance may be affected significantly by events in regions from which it derives its profits or in which it conducts significant operations. 4 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 Investing in emerging market countries involves risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign countries. The governments of emerging market countries may be more unstable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, intervene in the financial markets, and/or impose burdensome taxes that could adversely affect security prices. To the extent a foreign security is denominated in U.S. dollars, there is also the risk that a foreign government will not let U.S. dollar-denominated assets leave the country. In addition, the economies of emerging market countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Emerging market countries may also have less developed legal and accounting systems, and their legal systems may deal with issuer bankruptcies and defaults differently than U.S. law would. Securities markets in emerging market countries are also relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. Securities of issuers in emerging market countries may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of issuers in foreign countries with more developed economies or markets and the situation may require that the Fund fair value its holdings in those countries. Securities of issuers traded on foreign exchanges may be suspended, either by the issuers themselves, by an exchange, or by governmental authorities. The likelihood of such suspensions may be higher for securities of issuers in emerging or less-developed market countries than in countries with more developed markets. Trading suspensions may be applied from time to time to the securities of individual issuers for reasons specific to that issuer, or may be applied broadly by exchanges or governmental authorities in response to market events. Suspensions may last for significant periods of time, during which trading in the securities and in instruments that reference the securities, such as derivative instruments, may be halted. In the event that the Fund holds material positions in such suspended securities or instruments, the Fund's ability to liquidate its positions or provide liquidity to investors may be compromised and the Fund could incur significant losses. High Portfolio Turnover. The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading and may have a high portfolio turnover rate, which may increase the Fund's transaction costs, may adversely affect the Fund's performance and may generate a greater amount of capital gain distributions to shareholders than if the Fund had a low portfolio turnover rate. Inflation-Linked Debt Securities Risk. Inflation-linked debt securities are structured to provide protection against inflation. The value of the principal or the interest income paid on an inflation-linked debt security is adjusted to track changes in an official inflation measure. There can be no assurance that the inflation measure used will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and services. The value of inflation-linked debt securities is expected to change in response to changes in real interest rates. Real interest rates are tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. In general, the price of an inflation-linked debt security falls when real interest rates rise, and rises when real interest rates fall. Interest payments on inflation-linked debt securities will vary as the principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation and can be unpredictable. In periods of deflation, the Fund may have no income at all from such investments. The principal value of an investment in the Fund is not protected or otherwise guaranteed by virtue of the Fund's investments in inflation-linked debt securities. Interest Rate Risk. The Fund's yield and share price will fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates. In general, the value of investments with interest rate risk, such as debt securities, will move in the direction opposite to movements in interest rates. If interest rates rise, the value of such securities may decline. Typically, the longer the maturity or duration of a debt security, the greater the effect a change in interest rates could have on the security's price. Thus, the sensitivity of the Fund's debt securities to interest rate risk will increase with any increase in the duration of those securities. Inverse Floater Risk. An inverse floater earns interest at rates that vary inversely to changes in short-term interest rates. An inverse floater produces less income (and may produce no income) and may decline in value when market rates rise. An investment in an inverse floater may involve greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate security. Inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. An inverse floater may involve leverage, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile, increase interest rate risk and can magnify the Fund's losses. Issuer-Specific Risk. An individual security may be more volatile, and may perform differently, than the market as a whole. Leverage Risk. Leverage amplifies changes in the Fund's net asset value and may make the Fund more volatile. Derivatives and when-issued and forward-settling securities may create leverage and can result in losses to the Fund that exceed the amount originally invested and may accelerate the rate of losses. There can be no assurance that the Fund's use of any leverage will be successful. The Fund's investment exposure can exceed its net assets, sometimes by a significant amount. Liquidity Risk. From time to time, the trading market for a particular investment in which the Fund invests, or a particular type of instrument in which the Fund is invested, may become less liquid or even illiquid. Illiquid investments frequently can be more 5 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 difficult to purchase or sell at an advantageous price or time, and there is a greater risk that the investments may not be sold for the price at which the Fund is carrying them. Certain investments that were liquid when the Fund purchased them may become illiquid, sometimes abruptly. Additionally, market closures due to holidays or other factors may render a security or group of securities (e.g., securities tied to a particular country or geographic region) illiquid for a period of time. An inability to sell a portfolio position can adversely affect the Fund's value or prevent the Fund from being able to take advantage of other investment opportunities. Market prices for such securities or other investments may be volatile. During periods of substantial market volatility, an investment or even an entire market segment may become illiquid, sometimes abruptly, which can adversely affect the Fund's ability to limit losses. Unexpected episodes of illiquidity, including due to market or political factors, instrument or issuer-specific factors and/or unanticipated outflows, may limit the Fund's ability to pay redemption proceeds within the allowable time period. To meet redemption requests during periods of illiquidity, the Fund may be forced to sell securities at an unfavorable time and/or under unfavorable conditions. Loan Interests Risk. Loan interests generally are subject to restrictions on transfer, and the Fund may be unable to sell its loan interests at a time when it may otherwise be desirable to do so or may be able to sell them promptly only at prices that are less than what the Fund regards as their fair market value. Accordingly, loan interests may at times be illiquid. Loan interests may be difficult to value and may have extended settlement periods (the settlement cycle for many bank loans exceeds 7 days). Extended settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the Fund. As a result, during periods of unusually heavy redemptions, the Fund may have to sell other investments or borrow money to meet its obligations. A significant portion of floating rate loans may be ""covenant lite"" loans that may contain fewer or less restrictive constraints on the borrower and/or may contain other characteristics that would be favorable to the borrower, limiting the ability of lenders to take legal action to protect their interests in certain situations. Interests in loans made to finance highly leveraged companies or to finance corporate acquisitions or other transactions may be especially vulnerable to adverse changes in economic or market conditions. Interests in secured loans have the benefit of collateral and, typically, of restrictive covenants limiting the ability of the borrower to further encumber its assets. There is a risk that the value of any collateral securing a loan in which the Fund has an interest may decline and that the collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed on the loan. In the event the borrower defaults, the Fund's access to the collateral may be limited or delayed by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws. Further, in the event of a default, second or lower lien secured loans, and unsecured loans, will generally be paid only if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the borrower's obligations to the senior secured lenders, and the remaining collateral may not be sufficient to cover the full amount owed on the loan in which the Fund has an interest. Further, there is a risk that a court could take action with respect to a loan that is adverse to the holders of the loan and the Fund may need to retain legal counsel to enforce its rights in any resulting event of default, bankruptcy, or similar situation. Interests in loans expose the Fund to the credit risk of the underlying borrower and may expose the Fund to the credit risk of the lender. The Fund may acquire a loan interest by direct investment as a lender, by obtaining an assignment of all or a portion of the interests in a particular loan that are held by an original lender or a prior assignee or by participation in a loan interest that is held by another party. As an assignee, the Fund normally will succeed to all rights and obligations of its assignor with respect to the portion of the loan that is being assigned. However, the rights and obligations acquired by the purchaser of a loan assignment may differ from, and be more limited than, those held by the original lenders or the assignor. When the Fund's loan interest is a participation, the Fund may have less control over the exercise of remedies than the party selling the participation interest, and the Fund normally would not have any direct rights against the borrower. It is possible that the Fund could be held liable, or may be called upon to fulfill other obligations, with respect to loans in which it receives an assignment in whole or in part, or in which it owns a participation. The potential for such liability is greater for an assignee than for a participant. Lower-Rated Debt Securities Risk. Lower-rated debt securities (commonly known as ""junk bonds"") and unrated debt securities determined to be of comparable quality involve greater risks than investment grade debt securities. Such securities may fluctuate more widely in price and yield and may fall in price during times when the economy is weak or is expected to become weak. These securities also may require a greater degree of judgment to establish a price and may be difficult to sell at the time and price the Fund desires. Lower-rated debt securities are considered by the major rating agencies to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to pay principal and interest and carry a greater risk that the issuer of such securities will default in the timely payment of principal and interest. Issuers of securities that are in default or have defaulted may fail to resume principal or interest payments, in which case the Fund may lose its entire investment. The creditworthiness of issuers of these securities may be more complex to analyze than that of issuers of investment grade debt securities, and the overreliance on credit ratings may present additional risks. 6 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2023 Market Volatility Risk. Markets may be volatile and values of individual securities and other investments, including those of a particular type, may decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments that may cause broad changes in market value, public perceptions concerning these developments, and adverse investor sentiment or publicity. Geopolitical and other risks, including environmental and public health risks may add to instability in world economies and markets generally. Changes in value may be temporary or may last for extended periods. If the Fund sells a portfolio position before it reaches its market peak, it may miss out on opportunities for better performance. Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. The value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage instruments, will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market or the assets underlying the securities. These securities tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than other types of debt securities. In addition, investments in mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be subject to prepayment risk and extension risk, call risk, credit risk, valuation risk, and illiquid investment risk, sometimes to a higher degree than various other types of debt securities. These securities are also subject to the risk of default on the underlying mortgages or assets, particularly during periods of market downturn, and an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the underlying assets will adversely affect the security's value. Municipal Securities Risk. The municipal securities market could be significantly affected by adverse political and legislative changes, as well as uncertainties related to taxation or the rights of municipal security holders. Changes in the financial health of a municipality or other issuer, or an insurer of municipal securities, may make it difficult for it to pay interest and principal when due and may affect the overall municipal securities market. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the municipal securities of a particular state or U.S. territory or possession, there is greater risk that political, regulatory, economic or other developments within that jurisdiction may have a significant impact on the Fund's investment performance. Declines in real estate prices and general business activity may reduce the tax revenues of state and local governments. Municipal issuers have on occasion defaulted on obligations, been downgraded, or commenced insolvency proceedings. Because many municipal securities are issued to finance similar types of projects, especially those related to education, health care, housing, transportation, and utilities, conditions in those sectors can affect the overall municipal securities market. Interest on municipal securities paid out of current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific asset (so-called ""private activity bonds"") are generally not backed by the creditworthiness or taxing authority of the issuing governmental entity; rather, a particular business or facility may be the only source of revenue supporting payment of interest and principal, and declines in general business activity could affect the economic viability of that business or facility. Municipal bonds may be bought or sold at a market discount (i.e., a price less than the bond's principal amount or, in the case of a bond issued with original issue discount (""OID""), a price less than the amount of the issue price plus accrued OID). If the market discount is more than a de minimis amount, and if the bond has a maturity date of more than one year from the date it was issued, then any market discount that accrues annually, or any gains earned on the disposition of the bond, generally will be subject to federal income taxation as ordinary (taxable) income rather than as capital gains. Some municipal securities, including those in the high yield market, may include transfer restrictions similar to restricted securities (e.g., may only be transferred to qualified institutional buyers and purchasers meeting other qualification requirements set by the issuer). As such, it may be difficult to sell municipal securities at a time when it may otherwise be desirable to do so or the Fund may be able to sell them only at prices that are less than what the Fund regards as their fair market value. Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities, which are a form of hybrid security (i.e., a security with both debt and equity characteristics), may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities, however, unlike common stocks, participation in the growth of an issuer may be limited. Distributions on preferred securities are generally payable at the discretion of the issuer's board of directors and after the company makes required payments to holders of its debt securities. For this reason, preferred securities are subject to greater credit, interest, and liquidation risk than debt securities, and the value of preferred securities will usually react more strongly than debt securities to actual or perceived changes in the company's financial condition or prospects. Preferred securities of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred securities of larger companies. Preferred securities may be less liquid than common stocks. Prepayment and Extension Risk.","https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723620/000120677423000261/nb4155151-497k.htm","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"
