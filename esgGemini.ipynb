       "  'strategy': 'To pursue its goal, the Fund invests primarily in a diversified mix of debt securities. The Fund may invest in a broad array of securities, including: securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities; inflation-linked debt securities; municipal securities; foreign securities, including emerging markets; corporate bonds; commercial paper; mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities; and loans. Securities in which the Fund may invest may be issued by domestic and foreign governments, supranational entities (e.g. World Bank, IMF), corporate entities and trusts and may be structured as fixed rate debt; floating rate debt; and debt that may not pay interest from the time of issuance. The Fund may invest in debt securities across the credit spectrum, including investment grade securities, below investment grade securities and unrated securities, and may invest without limit in below investment grade securities (commonly known as \"junk bonds\"). The Fund considers debt securities to be below investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories by at least one independent credit rating agency or, if unrated, are determined by the Portfolio Managers to be of comparable quality. The Fund does not normally invest in or continue to hold securities that are in default or have defaulted with respect to the payment of interest or repayment of principal, but may do so depending on market or other conditions. The Fund may invest in or continue to hold securities that the Portfolio Managers believe have ratings or other factors that imply an imminent risk of default with respect to such payments. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments as a means of hedging risk and/or for investment purposes, which may include altering the Fund\\'s exposure to currencies, interest rates, inflation, sectors and individual issuers. These derivative instruments may include futures, forwards, including forward foreign currency contracts, and swaps, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps, options on futures and options on interest rate swaps, otherwise known as swaptions. The Fund may also invest without limit in foreign securities, which may be denominated in any currency including the local currency of the issuer, but normally will not invest more than 50% of its total assets at the time of investment in obligations of issuers in emerging market countries. The Fund considers emerging market countries to be countries included in the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index - Global Diversified, the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index - Diversified, the JPMorgan Emerging Local Markets Index or the JPMorgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified, as well as those countries which are not defined as a High Income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country by the World Bank. Additionally, the Fund may invest in tender option bonds (which include inverse floaters created as part of tender option bond transactions), convertible securities, restricted securities and preferred securities. The Fund may also engage in when-issued and forward-settling securities (such as to-be-announced (\"TBA\") mortgage-backed securities), which involve a commitment by the Fund to purchase securities that will be issued or settled at a later date. The Fund may enter into a TBA agreement and \"roll over\" such agreement prior to the settlement date by selling the obligation to purchase the securities set forth in the agreement and 2 Neuberger Berman Strategic Income Fund February 28, 2022 entering into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of mortgage-backed securities. The Fund may also hold cash and short-term securities, including cash equivalents and other debt obligations. The Fund may invest in debt securities of any maturity and does not have a target average duration. In an effort to achieve its goal, the Fund may engage in active and frequent trading. Investment Philosophy and Process The Portfolio Management Team\\'s investment philosophy is rooted in the belief that positive results can be achieved through a consistently applied, risk-managed approach to portfolio management that leverages the strengths of its proprietary fundamental research capabilities, decision-making frameworks, and quantitative risk management tools. The Portfolio Management Team employs an integrated investment process in managing the Fund. ■ Portfolio Strategy: The Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, which it monitors on an ongoing basis, including exposures to sectors (such as government, structured debt, credit, etc.) and duration/yield curve positioning, utilizing internally generated data that are produced by specialty sector investment teams in conjunction with asset allocation tools. ■ Strategy Implementation: Once the Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, the specialty sector investment teams and the Portfolio Management Team determine industry/sub-sector weightings and make securities selections within the types of securities that the Fund can purchase, such as investment grade securities, below investment grade securities, emerging market securities and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. When assessing the worth of a particular security, the teams utilize internally generated research and proprietary quantitatively driven tools and frameworks (including an analysis of cash flows, ability to pay principal and interest, balance sheet composition, and market positioning) to a) establish an internal outlook, b) evaluate the market\\'s outlook as it is reflected in asset prices, and c) contrast the two. The Fund\\'s Portfolio Managers systematically evaluate material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations as a factor in their investment analysis. The Portfolio Managers believe that ESG factors, like other more traditional subjects of investment analysis, have the potential to affect financial risk (e.g., an issuer\\'s overall credit profile) and investment returns. The Portfolio Managers conduct ongoing proprietary ESG research and proactively engage on ESG issues, supplemented by third-party ESG information, and use this as an input to the team\\'s internal credit ratings, which may be notched up or down depending on the ESG profile of an issuer. ESG considerations that the Portfolio Managers may consider include, but are not limited to: greenhouse gas emissions, data privacy and security, labor management, workforce diversity and inclusion, and business ethics, executive compensation and board composition. The consideration of ESG factors as part of the portfolio managers\\' investment process does not mean that the Fund pursues a specific \"impact\" or \"sustainable\" investment strategy. The teams will generally purchase securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is undervalued by the market and sell securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is overvalued by the market. The goal is to identify and evaluate investment opportunities that others may have missed.'},\n",

The fund normally invests primarily in equity securities of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies, including emerging market securities. Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 40% of its assets in non-U.S. securities. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the weighting of non-U.S. securities in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (the \"Index\") drops below 45%, the fund may invest a lower amount in non-U.S. securities, which will normally be such that the minimum level for non-U.S. securities will be 5% below the weighting of non-U.S. securities in the Index as of the most recently published month-end composition. As of December 31, 2023, the capitalization weighting of non-U.S. securities in the Index was approximately 47.4%. The fund is not managed with reference to the Index, and its primary performance benchmark is the MSCI All Country World Index.

The fund intends, but is not required, to hold stocks that are not included in the benchmark index. The fund may invest in issuers of any size market capitalization, including smaller capitalization companies. The fund may achieve its exposure to non-U.S. securities either directly or through depository receipts such as Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs). The portfolio managers begin with an investment universe comprised of more than 5,000 equity securities and assess individual securities using a disciplined investment process that integrates a focus on the ESG records of the issuers of such securities with proprietary fundamental, company- specific research and quantitative analysis. The portfolio managers utilize a sector analysis to screen out issuers based on revenue from sectors such as tobacco, thermal coal, alcohol, gambling and weapons. The portfolio managers use a proprietary ESG model scoring to evaluate and rate the securities in the investment universe. Based on this proprietary ESG scoring model, companies\\' ESG practices and risk factors are considered as part of the investment process, namely for the purposes of identifying tail risk factors (i.e., low probability factors that could have an outsized negative effect on performance) arising from a company\\'s ESG practices and understanding how a company\\'s ESG risk factors might affect the company and its performance. The portfolio managers believe that there are long-term benefits in an investment approach that attaches material weight to certain issues that receive less attention from traditional investment analysis, such as the environment, workplace relations, human rights, community relations, product safety and impact, and corporate governance and business ethics. The portfolio managers also believe that investing in companies with strong records for managing ESG risks can generate long-term competitive financial returns and positive societal impact and that companies that do not exhibit strong records with respect to ESG factors may be at a greater long-term risk of negative economic consequences. With respect to ESG factors, the portfolio managers will aim to invest the majority of the fund\\'s portfolio in stocks that they rate as best-in-class (i.e., NFJ ESG rated AAA, AA or A) and avoid stocks rated worst-in-class (i.e., NFJ rated B and CCC), although the portfolio managers maintain discretion to invest from time to time in companies with minimum ESG scores and to exclude companies with high ESG scores from the fund\\'s portfolio. The portfolio managers then analyze specific companies for possible investment through a disciplined, fundamental, bottom up-research process and quantitative analysis. In identifying potential investments, the portfolio managers ordinarily look for companies that exhibit some or all of the following characteristics: a strong record with respect to ESG factors; a demonstrated record of ESG risk management; long-term competitive advantage; a strong balance sheet; high barriers to entry in the company\\'s industry or area of business; and a strong record of capital discipline. The portfolio managers then seek to identify attractively-valued quality companies that exhibit growth characteristics. The portfolio managers construct the fund\\'s portfolio with the expectation that stock-specific risk will drive the fund\\'s returns over a complete market cycle and may reallocate the portfolio\\'s holdings in attempting to mitigate other risk factors, such as currency risk, country/regional risk, investment style risk, and sector risk, among others.

       "  'strategy': 'Under normal circumstances, the Fund will principally focus its investment activities in equity securities of companies that are positively exposed to long-term structural trends related to the energy transition associated with decarbonization. In particular, the strategy is focused on changes in the way energy is produced and consumed globally. Ecofin Advisors Limited, the investment sub-adviser to the Fund (the \"Sub-Adviser\" or \"Ecofin\") believes these long-term structural changes are creating secular winners and losers, resulting in investment opportunities. These companies are focused on more efficient use of resources and emissions reduction and include, but are not limited to the following sectors: consumer discretionary, energy, industrials, information technology, materials, and utilities. 2The Fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in equity securities of energy transition companies, which consist of companies (i) deriving at least 50% of their revenues or profit from or devoting at least 50% of their assets to activities in electrification, clean transportation, industrial and building efficiency, environment or other activities related to decarbonization associated with the energy transition, and in particular, opportunities from changes in the way energy is produced and consumed globally, or (ii) investing a significant portion of their capital expenditures in global energy transition activities with the intention of such activities becoming a significant part of their business. This will include those companies in technology, industrials, utilities, power, energy, chemicals, basic materials, infrastructure, consumer electronics, waste, water, transportation, automotive, semiconductors and other related environmental industries (\"Energy Transition Universe,\" and the companies therein being \"Energy Transition Companies\"). The Fund will not invest in any company whose principal business function is related to the extraction, development or transportation of oil, gas or other fossil fuels. The Fund\\'s investments in equity securities may include investments in other investment companies, real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"), foreign investment funds, preferred stocks, rights, warrants, convertible securities, and initial public offerings. The Fund will be invested in a range of both developed and non-developed markets, commensurate with its investment criteria. The Fund considers non-developed market countries to be those countries defined as such by the MSCI Market Classification Framework. The Energy Transition Universe is a global investment universe that includes companies mainly based in North America, Europe and Asia, but also includes companies in other regions to a lesser extent. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 40% of its total assets in foreign securities, which the Sub-Adviser considers to be companies organized outside of the United States, whose principal listing exchange is outside the United States, or who derive a significant portion of their revenue or profits outside the United States. The Fund\\'s investments in foreign securities may also include American Depository Receipts (\"ADRs\") and investments in non-developed market securities. The Energy Transition Universe includes a broad range of companies, ranging from small market capitalization companies to large market capitalization companies. The Fund may invest in companies of all market capitalizations. The Fund will concentrate in industries represented by Energy Transition Companies. Energy Transition Companies currently includes the following industries: technology, industrials, utilities, power, energy, chemicals, basic materials, infrastructure, consumer electronics, waste, water, transportation, automotive, semiconductors and other related environmental industries. The Fund is a non-diversified fund. 3The Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in debt securities, including but not limited to debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or government-related entities. The Fund may also invest in derivatives which are financial contracts whose values depend on, or are derived from, the values of underlying assets, reference rates, or indices. To manage risk, seek particular portfolio exposure as a substitute for a comparable market position in the underlying exposure, and/or to enhance return (including through the use of leverage), the Fund may invest in derivatives including options, futures, swap contracts and combinations of these instruments. The Fund may invest in futures, options and swap contracts on equity and debt securities, equity and debt indices and commodities (i) with aggregate net notional value of up to 100% of the Fund\\'s net assets, or (ii) for which the initial margin and premiums do not exceed 5% of its net assets, in each case excluding bona fide hedging transactions.The Sub-Adviser will seek to utilize a combined investment approach, assessing fundamental drivers alongside thematic, macroeconomic and regulatory factors. The Sub-Adviser will target active weights towards those investments that it believes would benefit from long-term structural trends and with attractive risk-adjusted intrinsic value. The Sub-Adviser uses a four-pronged research approach to construct the Fund\\'s portfolio, which assesses (1) qualitative factors, such as a company\\'s asset quality, management, stability of cash flows and environmental, social, governance (\"ESG\") factors; (2) quantitative factors, such as growth prospects, liquidity position and sensitivities to key drivers; (3) relative value through the analysis of valuation models and equity market indicators, and; (4) its global proprietary database of power generation companies. These active weights can change over time, relative to changes in fundamental outlook, corporate strategy, share prices, regulatory changes or other factors such as, but not limited to, balance sheet and liquidity considerations, ESG risk considerations, project success or jurisdictional policy issues. The Sub-Adviser incorporates ESG research into its investment process in an effort to provide better risk-adjusted returns to investors. ESG risk considerations may include, but are not limited to:•Environmental: (1) Scrutiny on carbon footprint and disclosure (and other greenhouse gas emissions); (2) Company\\'s time horizon for carbon neutrality; (3) Water use and land use; (4) Emission and waste reduction programs; (5) Research and development, innovation and thought leadership for sustainability; (6) Capital expenditures, maintenance and capital integrity; (7) Risks linked to stranded assets; (8) Climate change-related physical risks on assets (fire, weather, droughts, etc.); (9) Adverse policy support.•Social: (1) Impact on communities; (2) Customer satisfaction; (3) Commitment to safety standards; (4) Diversity in board, management and employees; (5) Employee engagement; (6) Commitment to fair and safe labor practice.•Governance: (1) Protection of minority shareholders; (2) Conflicts of interest; (3) Insider ownership; (4) Management compensation; (5) Financial and strategic transparency; (6) Board independence; (7) Engagement with management and proxy voting. 4The investment team may also seek to actively engage with portfolio companies to drive continuous business improvement in their ESG & sustainability practices and metrics, including but not limited to direct dialogue with senior leadership, active proxy voting and coordination with other owners. Where the investment team deem shareholder resolutions to contravene ESG principals, such as proposals that would reverse or delay progress towards net zero carbon goals or proposals that constitute a conflict of interest at the management or board level, then the investment team will vote against those specific resolutions. Resolutions are considered on a case-by-case basis.'},\n",

Equity securities include common stock and any rights to purchase common stock. \"Assets\" means net assets, plus the amount of borrowing for investment purposes. Shareholders will be given 60 days advance notice of any change to this policy. For these purposes, Boston Trust Walden Inc. (formerly, \"Boston Trust Investment Management, Inc.\") (the \"Adviser\") defines small and mid cap issuers as those with market capitalizations within the range encompassed by the Russell 2500TM Index at the time of purchase. The size of companies in the Russell 2500TM Index may change with market conditions. In addition, changes to the composition of the Russell 2500TM Index can change the market capitalization range of the companies included in the index. As of December 31, 2019, the market capitalization range of the Russell 2500TM Index was between $15.7 million and $27.2 billion. However, the Fund generally excludes securities with market capitalizations less than $500 million at time of purchase. The Adviser evaluates financially material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors as part of the investment decision-making process for the Fund. The Adviser considers financial materiality as it is understood in generally accepted accounting principles-information that would impact the judgment of an informed investor. The Adviser\\'s ESG analysis considers the range of impacts that ESG factors may have on future revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and overall risk. The Fund is subject to screening criteria in which the Adviser excludes companies with significant exposure in specific products or services, considering their revenue dependence (share of total revenue derived from undesirable products/services), market share (if a company is a market leader in an undesirable product despite relatively small share of total company revenue), and severity (how proximate is the product or service to the undesirable product-e.g., minor electronic input to a weapon system). Examples of products and services are found on page 33 of the Prospectus in the second paragraph under the heading \"Environmental, Social & Governance Guidelines.\" The Adviser also www.bostontrustwalden.com exercises its full discretion in evaluating the overall performance of each company, relative to ESG guidelines, assessing its impact on stakeholders, performance over time (relative to peers and established goals), and transparency.

The Fund invests primarily in high-yield, high-risk bonds with varying maturities, including distressed securities that are in default, which are rated lower than investment grade (i.e., bonds rated lower than Baa by Moody\\'s Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody\\'s\") or lower than BBB by S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\") or Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\")). For purposes of ratings restrictions, the average of S&P, Moody\\'s and Fitch is used. The Fund\\'s duration and maturity is managed tactically based on the investment adviser\\'s outlook for the fixed-income markets. For its investments, the Fund seeks to identify high-yield bonds of companies that have the ability to make timely payments of principal and interest. Using fundamental credit analysis of companies, the Fund seeks to invest in companies whose financial condition gives them greater value relative to other companies in the high-yield market, providing the further potential for capital appreciation. Consequently, capital appreciation is a secondary objective of the Fund. The Fund also may invest in trust preferred securities, taxable municipal obligations and loans. In addition, the Fund may invest up to 35% of its net assets in foreign debt securities. Foreign debt securities include American Depositary Receipts (\"ADRs\"). The Fund may also invest in investment grade bonds (i.e., bonds rated Baa or higher by Moody\\'s or BBB or higher by S&P). The Fund may engage in forward foreign currency exchange contracts to seek to hedge against the decline in the value of currencies in which its portfolio holdings are denominated against the U.S. dollar. The portfolio managers generally seek to hedge the Fund\\'s foreign currency exposure back to U.S. dollars, though the Fund may at any time have exposure to foreign currency. The Fund may invest in asset-backed securities (\"ABS\") and mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") that represent interests in pools of mortgage loans (MBS) or other assets (ABS) assembled for sale to investors by various U.S. governmental agencies, government-related organizations and private issuers. MBS may include collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") and commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\"). The Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in MBS and up to 10% of its net assets in ABS. Under certain market conditions, the Fund may opportunistically use a hedging technique that includes the purchase and sale of U.S. Treasury securities and related futures contracts (which are a type of derivative instrument) to manage the duration of the Fund and hedge interest rate risk. The Fund may invest in money market instruments. The Fund may also lend its securities. The investment adviser\\'s staff monitors the credit quality of securities held by the Fund and other securities available to the Fund. Although the investment adviser considers security ratings when making investment decisions, it performs its own credit and investment analysis utilizing various methodologies including \"bottom up/top down\" analysis and consideration of macroeconomic and technical factors, and does not rely primarily on the ratings assigned by the rating services. In conjunction with its financial analysis, investment decisions are made in consideration of the responsible investment criteria described below. The portfolio managers may also use sector rotation strategies in their management of the Fund. The portfolio managers may sell a security when the investment adviser\\'s valuation target is reached, the fundamentals of the investment change or to pursue more attractive investment options. A security will also be sold (in accordance with the investment adviser\\'s guidelines and at a time and in a manner that is determined to be in the best Calvert High Yield Bond Fund2Summary Prospectus dated February 1, 2023 interests of shareholders) if the investment adviser determines that the issuer does not operate in a manner consistent with the Fund\\'s responsible investment criteria.

Derivative instruments that provide exposure to such securities or have similar economic characteristics may be used to satisfy the fund\\'s 80% policy. The fund\\'s principal focus is on companies that exhibit solid fundamental characteristics and are underappreciated by the market. The fund may invest in securities of any market capitalization, and in securities in any industry or market sector. The fund may invest in both developed and emerging markets without limit. The fund may invest in initial public offerings of equity securities. The investment adviser seeks to identify companies with sustainable business models, including by evaluating environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. In keeping with this focus, the fund applies ESG criteria to its investments. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of borrowings, if any, for investment purposes) in securities of issuers that adhere to the fund\\'s ESG criteria. For purposes of the 80% investment policy, \"ESG criteria\" is defined as the exclusion of investments issued by companies significantly involved in the production of tobacco products and controversial military weapons, consisting of cluster weapons (a form of air-dropped or ground-launched explosive weapon that releases or ejects smaller submunitions), anti-personnel mines (a form of mine designed to be detonated by the presence or contact of a human), nuclear weapons, and biological and chemical weapons, and the operation of thermal coal mines. To the extent possible on the basis of information available to the adviser, an issuer will be deemed to be significantly involved in an activity if it derives more than 10% of its gross revenues from such activities. Normally, the fund invests at least a minimum percentage of its net assets in issuers located outside of the United States. The minimum percentage is the lesser of (a) 40% or (b) the percentage of the MSCI World NR Index that is represented by non-U.S. issuers from time to time minus 5 percentage points. For example, if non-U.S. issuers represent 42% of the MSCI World NR Index, the minimum percentage is 37%, and in that case the fund will normally invest at least 37% of its net assets in issuers located outside of the U.S. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the minimum percentage determined as described above is more than 30%, the minimum percentage may be reduced to 30% for so long as market conditions for these investments or in specific foreign markets are deemed unfavorable by the adviser. For the purposes of satisfying this policy, the fund may invest in derivative instruments that provide exposure to such non-U.S. issuers or have similar economic 4 characteristics. Non-U.S. issuers are issuers that are organized under the laws of a country outside of the United States, issuers with a principal office located in a country outside of the United States, issuers that derive at least 50% of their gross revenues or profits from goods or services produced in a country outside of the United States or sales made in a country outside of the United States, or issuers that have at least 50% of their assets in a country outside of the United States. For purposes of the fund\\'s investment policies, equity securities include common stocks and other equity instruments, such as funds that invest primarily in equity securities, depositary receipts, warrants, rights and preferred stocks. Subject to the 80% investment policy, the fund may invest in securities of issuers that do not adhere to the fund\\'s ESG criteria. Subject to the fund\\'s 80% investment policy, the fund may invest up to 20% of its total assets in debt securities, and cash and cash equivalents. Generally, the fund acquires investment grade debt securities, but the fund may invest up to 5% of its net assets in below investment grade debt securities (known as \"junk bonds\"). The fund may purchase and sell forward foreign currency exchange contracts in non-U.S. currencies in connection with its investments, including as a means of managing relative currency and country exposure. The fund may also use derivatives, including stock index futures and options and futures on equity-based volatility indices, for a variety of other purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against adverse changes in the market price of securities, interest rates or currency exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to attempt to increase the fund\\'s return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered speculative; to manage portfolio characteristics; and as a cash flow management technique. The fund may choose not to make use of derivatives for a variety of reasons, and any use may be limited by applicable law and regulations. The fund integrates a top-down view of the global macro-economic landscape with fundamental, bottom up, equity analysis. The investment process combines the skill of the adviser\\'s macroeconomic analyst and fundamental equity research teams in a rigorous risk adjusted portfolio construction process. Using this investment style, and considering ESG factors, the investment adviser seeks to invest in those issuers that have above average potential for sales and earnings growth that are also trading at attractive market valuations. In selecting stocks, the adviser employs fundamental research and an evaluation of the issuer based on its financial statements and operations. The adviser relies on the knowledge, experience and judgment of its staff and the staff of its affiliates who have access to a wide variety of research. The adviser focuses on the quality and valuation of issuers and securities. The 5 Summary Prospectus adviser generally sells a portfolio security when it believes that the issuer no longer offers the potential for above average earnings and sales growth. The adviser makes that determination based upon the same criteria it uses to select portfolio securities. In selecting securities to buy and sell, the adviser considers ESG factors along with the other investment-related factors discussed herein. In selecting securities, the adviser focuses on companies with sustainable business models. A company may demonstrate a sustainable business model by having a durable competitive and financial position expected to continue to create shareholder value, and offering products and services through ethical and sound business practices and the responsible use of resources. The adviser evaluates ESG-related risks as part of its research recommendations and integrates ESG analysis into its investment process, in addition to excluding investments based on the fund\\'s ESG criteria. Environmental assessment categories typically include climate change, natural resource use and waste management. Social assessment categories typically include human capital, product safety and social opportunities (social opportunities include access to health care, and nutritional, health-related, financial and educational programs). Governance assessment categories typically include corporate governance, business ethics and government and public policy. ESG-related concerns in one area might not automatically eliminate an issuer from being an eligible investment for the fund. Subject to the fund\\'s 80% policy, the adviser may consider whether an issuer\\'s ESG policies or practices are improving in making ESG evaluations. In addition to the fund\\'s 80% policy, the adviser generally will not invest fund assets in (i) companies that the adviser determines have significant involvement in the manufacturing of complete tobacco products, (ii) companies engaged in the production, sale, storage of, or providing services for, certain controversial weapons, including chemical, biological and depleted uranium weapons and certain antipersonnel mines and cluster bombs, (iii) companies with involvement in the production or sale of nuclear weapons, (iv) companies developing or planning to develop new thermal coal capacities, companies generating more than 20% of their revenue from thermal coal mining extraction, companies with annual thermal coal extraction of 70MT or more without intention to reduce, or companies with revenue in thermal coal mining extraction and thermal coal power generation that exceeds 50% of their revenue, or (v) issuers that violate, repeatedly and seriously, one or more of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, without credible corrective action. 6'},\n",

Securities in which the Fund may invest may be issued by domestic and foreign governments, corporate entities and trusts and may be structured as fixed rate debt, floating rate debt, and debt that may not pay interest from the time of issuance. The Fund may also engage in when-issued and forward-settling securities (such as to-be-announced (\"TBA\") mortgage-backed securities), which involve a commitment by the Fund to purchase securities that will be issued or settled at a later date. The Fund may enter into a TBA agreement and \"roll over\" such agreement prior to the settlement date by selling the obligation to purchase the securities set forth in the agreement and entering into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of mortgage-backed securities. The debt securities in which the Fund invests primarily are investment grade. The Fund considers debt securities to be investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated within the four highest categories by at least one independent credit rating agency or, if unrated, are determined by the Portfolio Managers to be of comparable quality. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments as a means of hedging risk and/or for investment purposes, which may include altering the Fund\\'s exposure to currencies, interest rates, inflation, sectors and individual issuers. These derivative instruments may include futures, forward foreign currency contracts, and swaps, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. The Fund normally will not invest more than 15% of its total assets in non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and, through hedging strategies, will attempt to limit its exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar to 5% of its total assets. Additionally, the Fund may invest in preferred securities. The Fund may also invest a significant amount of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities or other money market instruments depending on market conditions.

Investment Philosophy and Process The Portfolio Management Team\\'s investment philosophy is rooted in the belief that positive results can be achieved through a consistently applied, risk-managed approach to portfolio management that leverages the strengths of its proprietary fundamental research capabilities, decision-making frameworks, and quantitative risk management tools. The Portfolio Management Team employs an integrated investment process in managing the Fund. ■ Portfolio Strategy: The Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, which it monitors on an ongoing basis, including exposures to sectors (such as government, structured debt, credit, etc.) and duration/yield curve positioning, utilizing internally generated data that are produced by specialty sector investment teams in conjunction with asset allocation tools. ■ Strategy Implementation: Once the Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, the specialty sector investment teams and the Portfolio Management Team determine industry/sub-sector weightings and make securities selections within the types of securities that the Fund can purchase, such as investment grade securities and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. When assessing the value of a particular security, the teams utilize internally generated research and proprietary quantitatively driven tools and frameworks (including an analysis of cash flows, ability to pay principal and interest, balance sheet composition, and market positioning) to a) establish an internal outlook, b) evaluate the market\\'s outlook as it is reflected in asset prices, and c) contrast the two. The Fund\\'s Portfolio Managers systematically evaluate material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations as a factor in their investment analysis. The Portfolio Managers believe that ESG factors, like other more traditional subjects of investment analysis, have the potential to affect financial risk (e.g., an issuer\\'s overall credit profile) and investment returns. The Portfolio Managers conduct ongoing proprietary ESG research and proactively engage on ESG issues, supplemented by third-party ESG information, and use this as an input to the team\\'s internal credit ratings, which may be notched up or down depending on the ESG profile of an issuer. ESG considerations that the Portfolio Managers may consider include, but are not limited to: greenhouse gas emissions, data privacy and security, labor management, workforce diversity and inclusion, and business ethics, executive compensation and board composition. The consideration of ESG factors as part of the portfolio managers\\' investment process does not mean that the Fund pursues a specific \"impact\" or \"sustainable\" investment strategy. The teams will generally purchase securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is undervalued by the market and sell securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is overvalued by the market. The goal is to identify and evaluate investment opportunities that others may have missed.'},\n",

Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in bonds. The term \"bond\" includes any debt or fixed income security. The Fund normally invests in bonds that are rated \"investment grade\" by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (\"NRSRO\"), such as Moody\\'s Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody\\'s\") or S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\"), at the time of purchase. Investment grade securities are rated at least in the BBB/Baa major ratings categories by an NRSRO.

The Fund may continue to hold securities that are downgraded in credit rating subsequent to their purchase if GW&K believes it would be advantageous to do so. While the Fund may purchase debt securities of any duration, the Fund currently intends to primarily invest in debt securities so that the overall duration of the Fund\\'s portfolio will remain +/- 20% of the duration of its benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. As of November 30, 2020, the duration of the benchmark was 6.23 years. The average duration of debt securities in the Fund\\'s portfolio may, however, be shorter or longer depending on market conditions. The Fund may invest in debt securities issued by any of the following: public and private U.S. companies; the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank; and state and local governments issuing taxable municipal securities. The Fund may also invest in asset-backed and mortgage-backed debt securities. The Fund may also invest in bonds whose proceeds are reserved for financing the implementation of the United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals or other sustainable projects. GW&K\\'s investment process involves fundamental credit research and GW&K\\'s analysis of how the Fund\\'s potential investments are affected by material environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") factors. In selecting potential investments for the Fund, GW&K uses top-down research that focuses on managing duration, yield curve, credit quality, volatility and liquidity, as well as bottom-up research that focuses on fundamental analysis, valuation analysis, technical analysis, and ESG factor analysis. GW&K may adjust its assessment of an investment based on a number of considerations. In selecting debt securities issued by public and private U.S. companies and state and local governments issuing taxable municipal securities, GW&K applies its ESG factor analysis. GW&K has created its own proprietary ESG Scoring System, which takes into consideration a range of factors, including independent analysis from third parties, such as MSCI Inc. and Sustainalytics, as well as its own analysis of material ESG factors. Each of GW&K\\'s sector specialists generally assesses the materiality of relevant environmental, social and governance metrics to bond issues during the fundamental research process, depending on the sector and for corporate issuers the nature of the company\\'s business. GW&K uses standards developed by the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board to inform these assessments. Environmental assessment may take into account issues such as carbon emissions, natural resource usage, hazardous waste, chemical safety, water stress and sustainable technology. Social assessment may take into account issues such as human rights, labor relations, employee safety, product safety, data security and community relations. Governance assessment may take into account issues such as business ethics, board quality, board composition, compensation practices, financial reporting and stakeholder governance. GW&K recognizes that the relative impact of ESG factors on investment performance may vary across market sector, industries and regions, but the firm believes that responsible corporate behavior with respect to ESG factors can contribute to positive and sustainable long-term financial performance. GW&K seeks to identify issuers that GW&K believes are leaders in their industries in effectively addressing exposure to ESG risks through business practices, policies and programs, or issuers within an industry that have more limited exposure to ESG risks. The goal of the ESG factor analysis is to seek investments with lesser exposure to, or better management of, ESG risks.'},\n",

The Fund may hedge against currency risk or interest rate risk by using SUM081-0521 AMG Beutel Goodman Core Plus Bond Fund SUMMARY PROSPECTUS forward foreign currency contracts and futures, respectively, or by using other techniques, but it is not required to do so. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its assets in below investment grade securities (common known as \"junk bonds\" or \"high yield securities\"). Below investment grade securities are rated below Baa3 by Moody\\'s Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody\\'s\") or below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\") or similarly rated by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or unrated but determined by Beutel, Goodman & Company Ltd., the subadviser to the Fund (\"Beutel Goodman\" or the \"Subadviser\"), to be of comparable credit quality. In cases where the credit ratings agencies have assigned different credit ratings to the same security, the security will be considered to have the higher credit rating. The Fund may continue to hold securities that are downgraded in credit rating subsequent to their purchase if Beutel Goodman believes it would be advantageous to do so. The Fund intends to invest primarily in bonds with a rating of B or higher by any NRSRO at the time of purchase. The Fund expects that the average credit rating of the Fund\\'s portfolio will be BBB or above. While the Fund may purchase fixed income securities of any duration, the Fund currently intends to primarily invest in fixed income securities so that the overall duration of the Fund\\'s portfolio will remain +/- 2 years of the duration of the Fund\\'s benchmark (the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index), which was 6.39 years as of April 30, 2021. The average duration of fixed income securities in the Fund\\'s portfolio may, however, be shorter or longer depending on market conditions. The Subadviser actively manages the Fund\\'s portfolio using top-down macroeconomic analysis and bottom-up fundamental credit research to determine relative value and build what it views as a high conviction portfolio. A variety of qualitative and quantitative tools are used in the research process. The Subadviser\\'s data-driven top-down analysis assesses interest rate anticipation (duration), yield curve positioning and sector positioning. Inflation, the political climate, monetary policy and economic activity are among the variables used to determine the overall duration target for the Fund, and the Fund\\'s maturity structure will be adjusted to reflect the Subadviser\\'s forecast for interest rates. The Fund\\'s overall corporate credit positioning and sector selection are determined based on the Subadviser\\'s economic and interest rate anticipation analysis. In selecting individual securities for the Fund, the Subadviser conducts fundamental credit research that employs, among other things, detailed financial modeling, industry analysis, analysis of regulatory filings, management meetings and credit rating reports. The Subadviser evaluates potential investments based on the following elements: liquidity, transparency, non-cyclicality, financial models, and environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") criteria. The Subadviser uses proprietary risk management tools to manage the Fund\\'s interest rate risk, yield curve risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Subadviser integrates the analysis of ESG factors as part of the fundamental credit research process used to identify potential corporate bond positions for the Fund. Environmental factors include, but are not limited to, greenhouse gas intensity, reclamation, power generation, carbon offsets and land usage. Governance factors include, but are not limited to, executive compensation, structural complexity, board independence, board compensation and bondholder rights. Social factors include, but are not limited to, diversity, health and safety, human rights, indigenous nations, engagement and community outreach. Consideration of ESG factors is one element of the Subadviser\\'s investment process. The Subadviser views ESG issues not only as potential sources of risk, but also as opportunities for improvement. ESG-related risk exposure will not therefore preclude an investment, although the Subadviser does not generally expect to make investments where ESG factors make it difficult to accurately assess the value of a business. Beutel Goodman prepares and maintains credit reports for the Fund\\'s investments and the ESG analysis included in each corporate credit report includes: an overall ESG risk assessment; granular ESG metrics; ESG score peer group benchmarking (using third party data providers such as Sustainalytics and MSCI); listing of ESG strengths and weakness; ESG-related engagement themes; and an ESG scorecard by individual topic. In performing ESG analysis, the Subadviser obtains information from company financial statements and other reports, interviews with company management, investment dealer reports, and data from other third parties. From time to time, the Subadviser may also engage with management regarding ESG matters relevant to the company.'},\n",

       "  'strategy': 'The Fund invests in government bonds issued by emerging market countries pursuant to the investment manager\\'s investment strategy that emphasizes the current and projected sustainability efforts of emerging market countries in certain environmental, social and governance (ESG) categories (sustainability investment strategy). The investment manager\\'s sustainability investment strategy is based on its premise that when emerging market countries are evaluated on their ESG practices, they will score lower than developed market countries. A disparity in economic resources and the resulting lower absolute ESG score will often cause emerging markets to be overlooked or excluded from traditional investment strategies that only incorporate a snap-shot of current ESG scores. As a result, to counterbalance this disparity, the investment manager also evaluates an emerging market country\\'s momentum in improving its sustainability efforts, and, therefore, its ESG score, over the near to medium term, because it believes that projected positive change is an important tool in forecasting the long-term economic, social and political development of a country and the potential increase in the value of its bonds. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in a non-diversified portfolio of bonds issued by \"emerging market countries.\" For purposes of the Fund\\'s 80% policy, the bonds in which the Fund invests consist of treasuries and government debt typically backed by the full faith and credit of the government and issued for the purpose of financing the emerging market country\\'s general growth and development. In addition, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of the Fund\\'s net assets are invested in or exposed to government bonds of emerging market countries that are determined by the investment manager, at the time of purchase, to score: (i) in the highest 50% of emerging market countries in the Templeton Global Macro ESG Index (TGM-ESGI) universe based on their current overall environmental, social and governance score; or (ii) in the highest 80% of emerging market countries in the TGM-ESGI universe based on their current overall environmental, social and governance score and that have a positive or neutral sustainability momentum (i.e., the difference between a country\\'s projected score and its current score over time). The investment manager counts toward the Fund\\'s 80% policies the notional value of derivatives and other instruments that provide long exposure to the interest rates, currencies or sovereign credit of bonds issued by emerging market countries. \"Emerging market countries\" are countries considered to be emerging or frontier markets by the International Monetary Fund or the United Nations; countries included as emerging or frontier markets by S&P Dow Jones, Morgan Stanley Capital International or FTSE Russell index providers; and countries in the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index - Global (EMBIG), JPMorgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Broad (GBI-EM Broad) or JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index Broad (CEMBI Broad) fixed income indexes. Emerging market countries typically are located in the Asia Pacific region, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central and South America and Africa. In employing its sustainability investment strategy, the investment manager uses the TGM-ESGI, which is a proprietary ESG scoring system, to assess a country\\'s sustainability practices. Government bonds and instruments that have economic characteristics similar to government bonds (together, \"government bonds\") issued by emerging market (including frontier market) countries in the TGM-ESGI universe comprise the Fund\\'s \"Investible Universe.\" The TGM-ESGI ranks countries according to current and projected overall ESG scores based on each country\\'s scores in fourteen ESG subcategories that the investment manager has determined have significant impact on macroeconomic conditions. The investment manager believes this two-pronged approach (i.e., current and projected ESG scores) best represents the investment worthiness of a country as compared to other countries based on a country\\'s sustainability efforts and promotes ESG by investing the Fund\\'s assets in emerging markets countries that are considered leaders and/or are expected to improve from an ESG perspective, as compared to other emerging market countries. In ranking the countries in the TGM-ESGI universe on their sustainability practices and efforts, the investment manager assigns each country current and projected scores on a scale of 0 to 100 (100 being the highest) in each of the fourteen ESG subcategories. The investment manager bases the current scores in these subcategories on data provided by third-party index providers, as described in more detail below. Each country\\'s projected scores in the ESG subcategories are calculated by using the country\\'s current score as a base, and overlaying the investment manager\\'s discretionary views on expected developments across the ESG subcategories over the next two to three years based on its proprietary research, which includes a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors and leverages information from the investment manager\\'s individual country analysts who have a deep understanding of local conditions in specific countries and extensive knowledge of such countries\\' policies and societal trends. The fourteen subcategories, the investment manager\\'s views on the impacts of such ESG factors on a country\\'s economic sustainability, and the third-party index providers on which the investment manager bases its scoring, as of the date of this prospectus, are set forth below. The subcategories, the investment manager\\'s views on the impact of a factor on a country\\'s economic sustainability and the third-party index providers used for scoring may change over time without notice to shareholders. Environmental:· Resource insecurity – As the global population increases and demands higher standards of living, the consumption of limited resources has increased. Resources can include the basic needs of any population, like water and farmable land, or economic needs such as fuel and minerals. Resource insecurity and depletion can threaten to disrupt established industries, particularly for countries dependent on resource-dependent economic activity such as agriculture, fishing and mining. Third-party index providers: World Energy Council Energy Security; Economist Intelligence Unit, Global Food Security Index; Energy: World Energy Council\\'s Energy Trilemma, Energy Security; Water: World Resources Institute Water Stress; Food: EIU Global Food Security Index. · Extreme weather risk – Natural disasters such as droughts, monsoons, earthquakes and hurricanes can have large, disruptive impacts on an economy. While weather patterns cannot be predicted, the investment manager can be aware of the risks they pose and how well a country can handle such disasters in light of the vulnerability of its infrastructure, its emergency response abilities, and the adequacy of its early warning systems. For example, one macroeconomic impact of extreme weather risk falls on the price of goods; disasters such as droughts or hurricanes can severely disrupt availability of necessities like food or energy. Third-party index providers: United Nations Institution for Environment and Human Security World Risk Report.· Unsustainable practices – The sustainability of a country\\'s treatment of the natural environment such as air, water and land are critical for current and future wellbeing. Unsustainable practices range from emissions to water pollution to destruction of biodiversity. Pollution can result in large cleanup costs and poorer health of citizens and may draw international opposition that hinders development. Third-party index providers: Social Progress Index Environmental Quality.Social:· Social cohesion and stability – Lack of social cohesion comes in many forms, including terrorism, violent demonstrations and ethnic or religious conflicts. Active conflicts can lead to instability that negatively impacts economic conditions. Decay of social cohesion can also be harmful when savvy politicians take advantage of it. Recent waves of protectionism and anti-immigration sentiment are results of such dynamics. Third-party index providers: World Bank Governance Indicators, Political Stability and Absence of Violence.· Infrastructure – Infrastructure refers to the quality and extension of transport (road, rail, water and air) and utility infrastructure. Strong infrastructure helps develop business activity and constitutes an important gauge of whether the government takes a long-term view of economic issues. Investment in infrastructure not only provides a temporary boost to a country\\'s gross domestic product (GDP) through employment and construction, but necessary projects also can expand growth potential for years to come. Lack of adequate infrastructure can cause issues such as supply bottlenecks and inflationary pressures. Third-party index providers: WEF Global Competitiveness Report, Infrastructure.· Health security – Health security is determined by the measurement of the coping ability of countries when faced with epidemic and pandemic diseases, and reflects the quality and robustness of a country\\'s health systems, as well as its ability to prevent, detect and respond swiftly to the spread of diseases. Lack of health security can cause health system and health security overloads, reductions in production and services and deterioration of fiscal and monetary conditions, as seen recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. Third-party index providers: Global Health Security Index (GHS Index).· Labor – Labor refers to the regulatory framework of a country\\'s labor market, such as regulations around minimum wage, severance, hiring and hours worked. It also refers to the distribution of wealth within the population. The investment manager looks for fair pay that allows citizens to consume and participate in the economy, as well as competitiveness and the ability of corporations to allocate resources effectively. Labor and wages can impact complicated issues such as competitiveness and productivity. Third-party index providers: Heritage Foundation Labor Freedom Index, World Bank GINI Index (last available).· Human capital – Human capital refers to the skill of a country\\'s workforce, the country\\'s investment in formal education and accumulation of skills through work. Lack of human capital in a country affects the productive ability of any economy. Similarly, policies that encourage diverse labor force participation can structurally increase labor\\'s contribution to growth. Third-party index providers: World Economic Forum, Human Capital Report.· Demographics – This category looks at the amount of youth participation in the labor force that do not have work. In addition, demographics refers to labor force growth, which includes the change in labor force size and the amount of individuals age 15 and older who are working or are seeking work. Issues such as rapid population growth, aging and immigration may affect the size of the working population. A growing population can both aid in growth potential as well as create challenges for governments to generate enough jobs or risk social instability. Third-party index providers: World Bank Youth Unemployment, World Bank Labor Force Growth.Governance:· Business climate – This category evaluates the business-friendliness of a country\\'s rules and institutions. Business climate impacts investment levels and capital flows. Targeted tax breaks or special industrial zones can encourage domestic capital expenditure, and removing restrictions on foreign ownership of business in key sectors can significantly boost capital inflows as well as improve productivity. Third-party index providers: World Bank Doing Business Index.· Institutional strength –This category measures the extent to which the rules of society are followed in a country and the quality of contract enforcement (e.g., strength of courts and police). For example, a fiscal rule embedded in the constitution has stronger credibility than one periodically subject to legislative votes. Greater institutional strength often leads to a less volatile economy. Third-party index providers: World Bank Governance Indicators, Rule of Law.· Corruption and transparency – Corruption refers to the extent to which public officials exercise power for private gain, at both federal and local levels. Transparency refers to data availability and reliability. Corruption can result in major political scandals that impact the government\\'s effectiveness and also distract from productive policy. Other effects of corruption can be unreliable government statistics for research purposes and international sanctions or withdrawal of international aid. A lack of transparency can worsen these effects. Third-party index providers: World Bank Governance Indicators, Control of Corruption.· Policy mix and reform mindedness – This category looks at a country\\'s ability to formulate and implement sound policies (e.g. burden of regulations, unfair competitive practices and tax inconsistency). Countries are rewarded for being willing to pass unpopular but necessary reforms and policy to address economic and political challenges. Policy direction has an important impact on macroeconomics. Examples include whether leadership stands prepared to enact fiscal austerity (such as pension reform or subsidy removal) for the sake of a sustainable debt path and the government\\'s willingness to service debt, which directly impacts asset prices. Third-party index providers: World Bank Governance Indicators, Regulatory Quality.· Effectiveness – Effectiveness looks at the degree of governance that is independent from political pressures, the quality of policy formation and the credibility of a government\\'s commitment (e.g., bureaucratic quality and institutional effectiveness). A government\\'s effectiveness contributes critically to the approval and implementation of policy. Strong ideas and intent can be hamstrung by political inexperience and inability to overcome opposition. An example would be gridlock in the legislature between majority and minority coalitions. Third-party index providers: World Bank Governance Indicators, Government Effectiveness.Once the current and projected scores are calculated in each of the subcategories listed above, the investment manager calculates an average current and projected score for each country in each of the three main categories: environmental, social and governance. Final combined current and projected scores are then calculated for each country by applying an equal weight (33 1/3%) to each of the environmental, social and governance category scores. The countries are ranked on the TGM-ESGI according to their overall current score. Under normal market conditions, when selecting the countries in which the Fund will invest, the investment manager generally manages the Fund so that the weighted average base ESG score of the countries in the Fund\\'s portfolio (including currency and derivatives that provide exposure to countries in the Fund\\'s Investible Universe) is higher than the average base ESG score of the top 80% of countries in the Fund\\'s Investible Universe. Compliance with this policy will be tested on a weekly basis. At certain times the Fund\\'s weighted average base ESG score may fall below the average base ESG score of the top 80% of countries in the Fund\\'s Investible Universe. At such times, the investment manager will manage the Fund so that the weighted average base ESG score of the countries in the Fund\\'s portfolio returns to be higher than the average base ESG score of the top 80% of countries in the Fund\\'s Investible Universe as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, government bonds of the poorest performing countries in each of the environmental, social or governance categories based on current scores are excluded from investment until the exclusions reach 20% of the Fund\\'s Investible Universe. The Fund also excludes from its investments government bonds of countries that have been sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the European Union or the United Nations. As noted above, the Fund\\'s investments may include government bonds of countries that are either (i) in the highest 50% of emerging market countries in the TGM-ESGI universe based on their current overall environmental, social and governance score; or (ii) in the highest 80% of emerging market countries in the TGM-ESGI universe based on their current overall environmental, social and governance score that have a positive or neutral sustainability momentum (i.e., the difference between a country\\'s projected score and its current score over time, typically two to three years). TGM-ESGI scoring is applied to 100% of the countries in which the Fund has or may have exposure to government bonds. The Fund measures compliance with its principal investment strategies at the time of investment. If a country no longer meets the above criteria, the investment manager will monitor the country\\'s projected scores and momentum and may, but is not required to, hedge exposure to the country or sell the bonds issued by such country. The ESG subcategories, weightings for the categories when calculating scores, and third-party index providers used for scoring are reviewed at least biannually. Although market activity, political and macroeconomic events, conditions in fixed income markets and specific investment opportunities are discussed and reviewed frequently, the investment manager formally updates the ESG research and scores twice a year, which may include refinements in the investment manager\\'s methodology. In addition, the investment manager continuously conducts look-back assessments of the accuracy of ESG projections from previous years and how directional trends in ESG have aligned with actual investment performance over time. Updates to the TGM-ESGI methodology and the current and projected scores for each country typically are released to the public twice a year, but the timing of such updates are subject to change without notice to shareholders. The investment manager believes that ESG considerations are most effective when fully integrated into the other components of the investment manager\\'s traditional economic analysis. In selecting the investments for the Fund\\'s portfolio, the investment manager also employs a research-driven investment process that combines qualitative, country-specific and global macroeconomic analysis with quantitative tools. In addition to ESG factors, the investment manager considers various macroeconomic factors including the growth drivers, monetary policy, fiscal policy, inflation dynamic, debt sustainability, balance of debt payments and the political situation of each country. In addition, the investment manager considers the risk versus return analysis and liquidity of each government bond. The Fund is a \"non-diversified\" fund, which means it generally invests a greater portion of its assets in the securities of one or more issuers and invests overall in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. The bonds in which the Fund may invest include debt obligations of any maturity, such as bonds, notes, bills and debentures, and the average maturity of debt obligations in the Fund\\'s portfolio will fluctuate depending on the investment manager\\'s outlook on changing market, economic, and political conditions. The Fund may buy bonds rated in any category or that are unrated, and such obligations may have fixed or floating rates of interest. Bonds may be denominated and issued in the local currency or in another currency. The Fund may also invest in inflation-indexed securities and securities that are linked to or derive their value from another security, asset or currency of any nation. For purposes of pursuing its investment goals the Fund regularly enters into various currency related transactions involving derivative instruments, principally currency and cross currency forwards, but it may also use currency and currency index futures contracts and currency options. The Fund maintains extensive positions in currency related derivative instruments as a hedging technique or to implement a currency investment strategy, which could expose a large amount of the Fund\\'s assets to obligations under these instruments. The results of such transactions may represent, from time to time, a large component of the Fund\\'s investment returns. The use of these derivative transactions may allow the Fund to obtain net long or net negative (short) exposure to selected currencies. The Fund also may enter into various other transactions involving derivatives from time to time, including interest rate/bond futures and swap agreements (which may include credit default swaps and interest rate swaps). The use of these derivative transactions may allow the Fund to obtain net long or net short exposures to selected interest rates, countries, duration or credit risks, or may be used for hedging purposes. The Fund may use any of the above currency techniques or other derivative transactions for the purposes of enhancing Fund returns, increasing liquidity, gaining exposure to particular instruments in more efficient or less expensive ways and/or hedging risks relating to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and other market factors. The investment manager considers various factors, such as availability and cost, in deciding whether to use a particular derivative instrument or strategy. Moreover, investors should bear in mind that the Fund is not obligated to actively engage in any derivative transactions. The Fund may, at times, maintain a large position in cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds).'},\n",

The Fund may invest in a broad array of securities, including: securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities; inflation-linked debt securities; municipal securities; foreign securities, including emerging markets; corporate bonds; commercial paper; mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities; and loans. Securities in which the Fund may invest may be issued by domestic and foreign governments, supranational entities (e.g. World Bank, IMF), corporate entities and trusts and may be structured as fixed rate debt; floating rate debt; and debt that may not pay interest at the time of issuance. The Fund may invest in debt securities across the credit spectrum, including investment grade securities, below investment grade securities and unrated securities, and may invest without limit in below investment grade securities (commonly known as \"junk bonds\"). The Fund considers debt securities to be below investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories by at least one independent credit rating agency or, if unrated, are determined by the Portfolio Managers to be of comparable quality. The Fund does not normally invest in or continue to hold securities that are in default or have defaulted with respect to the payment of interest or repayment of principal, but may do so depending on market or other conditions. The Fund may invest in or continue to hold securities that the Portfolio Managers believe have ratings or other factors that imply an imminent risk of default with respect to such payments. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments as a means of hedging risk and/or for investment purposes, which may include altering the Fund\\'s exposure to currencies, interest rates, inflation, sectors and individual issuers. These derivative instruments may include futures, forwards, including forward foreign currency contracts, and swaps, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps, options on futures and options on interest rate swaps, otherwise known as swaptions. The Fund may also invest without limit in foreign securities, which may be denominated in any currency including the local currency of the issuer, but normally will not invest more than 50% of its total assets at the time of investment in obligations of issuers in emerging market countries. The Fund considers emerging market countries to be countries included in the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index - Global Diversified, the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index - Diversified, the JPMorgan Emerging Local Markets Index or the JPMorgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified, as well as those countries which are not defined as a High Income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country by the World Bank. Additionally, the Fund may invest in tender option bonds (which include inverse floaters created as part of tender option bond transactions), convertible securities, restricted securities and preferred securities. The Fund may also engage in when-issued and forward-settling securities (such as to-be-announced (\"TBA\") mortgage-backed securities), which involve a commitment by the Fund to purchase securities that will be issued or settled at a later date. The Fund may enter into a TBA agreement and \"roll over\" such agreement prior to the settlement date (e.g., mortgage dollar rolls) by selling the obligation to purchase the securities set forth in the agreement and entering into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of mortgage-backed securities. The Fund may also hold cash and short-term securities, including cash equivalents and other debt obligations. The Fund may invest in debt securities of any maturity and does not have a target average duration. In an effort to achieve its goal, the Fund may engage in active and frequent trading.

The Portfolio Management Team employs an integrated investment process in managing the Fund. ■ Portfolio Strategy: The Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, which it monitors on an ongoing basis, including exposures to sectors (such as government, structured debt, credit, etc.) and duration/yield curve positioning, utilizing internally generated data that are produced by specialty sector investment teams in conjunction with asset allocation tools. ■ Strategy Implementation: Once the Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, the specialty sector investment teams and the Portfolio Management Team determine industry/sub-sector weightings and make securities selections within the types of securities that the Fund can purchase, such as investment grade securities, below investment grade securities, emerging market securities and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. 2 Neuberger Berman Strategic Income Fund February 28, 2020 When assessing the worth of a particular security, the teams utilize internally generated research and proprietary quantitatively driven tools and frameworks (including an analysis of cash flows, ability to pay principal and interest, balance sheet composition, market positioning, and the team\\'s assessment of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors) to a) establish an internal outlook, b) evaluate the market\\'s outlook as it is reflected in asset prices, and c) contrast the two. The teams then use the information generated by this process to decide which securities the Fund will own. The teams will generally purchase securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is undervalued by the market and sell securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is overvalued by the market.

       "  'strategy': 'To pursue its goal, the Fund invests primarily in a diversified mix of debt securities. The Fund may invest in a broad array of securities, including: securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities; inflation-linked debt securities; municipal securities; foreign securities, including emerging markets; corporate bonds; commercial paper; mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities; and loans. Securities in which the Fund may invest may be issued by domestic and foreign governments, supranational entities (e.g. World Bank, IMF), corporate entities and trusts and may be structured as fixed rate debt; floating rate debt; and debt that may not pay interest from the time of issuance. NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2024 While the Fund may invest in debt securities across the credit spectrum, including investment grade securities, below investment grade securities and unrated securities, and may invest without limit in below investment grade securities (commonly known as \"junk bonds\"), under normal market conditions, the Portfolio Managers anticipate that the Fund\\'s average credit quality will be investment grade. The Fund considers debt securities to be below investment grade if, at the time of investment, they are rated below the four highest categories by at least one independent credit rating agency or, if unrated, are determined by the Portfolio Managers to be of comparable quality. The Fund does not normally invest in or continue to hold securities that are in default or have defaulted with respect to the payment of interest or repayment of principal, but may do so depending on market or other conditions. The Fund may invest in or continue to hold securities that the Portfolio Managers believe have ratings or other factors that imply an imminent risk of default with respect to such payments. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments as a means of hedging risk and/or for investment or efficient portfolio management purposes, which may include altering the Fund\\'s exposure to currencies, interest rates, inflation, sectors and individual issuers. These derivative instruments may include futures, forwards, including forward foreign currency contracts, and swaps, such as total return swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps, options on futures and options on interest rate swaps, otherwise known as swaptions. While the fund may invest without limit in foreign securities, the Fund will invest primarily in debt securities issued by U.S. corporations or by the U.S. government and any of its agencies. The Fund normally will not invest more than 30% of its total assets at the time of investment in obligations of issuers in emerging market countries. The Fund considers emerging market countries to be countries included in the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index - Global Diversified, the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index - Diversified, the JPMorgan Emerging Local Markets Index or the JPMorgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets Global Diversified, as well as those countries which are not defined as a High Income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country by the World Bank. Additionally, the Fund may invest in tender option bonds (which include inverse floaters created as part of tender option bond transactions), convertible securities, restricted securities and preferred securities. The Fund may also engage in when-issued and forward-settling securities (such as to-be-announced (\"TBA\") mortgage-backed securities), which involve a commitment by the Fund to purchase securities that will be issued or settled at a later date. The Fund may enter into a TBA agreement and \"roll over\" such agreement prior to the settlement date by selling the obligation to purchase the securities set forth in the agreement and entering into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of mortgage-backed securities. The Fund may also hold cash and short-term securities, including cash equivalents and other debt obligations. The Fund may invest in debt securities of any maturity and while the Fund does not have a target average duration, under normal market conditions, the Portfolio Managers anticipate that the Fund\\'s average duration will be between two and eight years. In an effort to achieve its goal, the Fund may engage in active and frequent trading. Investment Philosophy and Process The Portfolio Management Team\\'s investment philosophy is rooted in the belief that positive results can be achieved through a consistently applied, risk-managed approach to portfolio management that leverages the strengths of its fundamental research capabilities, decision-making frameworks, and quantitative risk management tools. The Portfolio Management Team employs an integrated investment process in managing the Fund. ■ Portfolio Strategy: The Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, which it monitors on an ongoing basis, including exposures to sectors (such as government, structured debt, credit, etc.) and duration/yield curve positioning, utilizing internally generated views that are produced by specialty sector investment teams in conjunction with asset allocation tools. ■ Strategy Implementation: Once the Portfolio Management Team establishes the investment profile for the Fund, the specialty sector investment teams and the Portfolio Management Team determine industry/sub-sector weightings and make securities selections within the types of securities that the Fund can purchase, such as investment grade securities, below investment grade securities, emerging market securities and non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. When assessing the worth of a particular security, the teams utilize internally generated research and proprietary quantitatively driven tools and frameworks (including an analysis of cash flows, ability to pay principal and interest, balance sheet composition, and market positioning) to a) establish an internal outlook, b) evaluate the market\\'s outlook as it is reflected in asset prices, and c) contrast the two. As part of their fundamental investment analysis the Portfolio Managers consider Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors they believe are financially material to individual investments, where applicable, as described below. While this analysis is inherently subjective and may be informed by internally generated and third-party metrics, data and other information, the Portfolio Managers believe that the consideration of financially material ESG factors, alongside traditional 2 NEUBERGER BERMAN STRATEGIC INCOME FUND February 28, 2024 financial metrics, may improve credit analysis, security selection, relative value analysis and enhance the Fund\\'s overall investment process. The specific ESG factors considered and scope and application of integration may vary depending on the specific investment and/or investment type. The consideration of ESG factors does not apply to certain instruments, such as certain derivative instruments, other registered investment companies, cash and cash equivalents. The consideration of ESG factors as part of the investment process does not mean that the Fund pursues a specific \"impact\" or \"sustainable\" investment strategy. The teams will generally purchase securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is undervalued by the market and sell securities if their internal outlook suggests a security is overvalued by the market. The goal is to identify and evaluate investment opportunities that others may have missed.'},\n",

Investment decisions for the fixed-income portion of the Fund are made primarily on the basis of fundamental and quantitative research conducted by the investment adviser\\'s research staff and consideration of the responsible investing criteria described below. Management of the Fund involves consideration of numerous factors (such as quality of business franchises, financial strength, management quality and security structural and collateral considerations). The portfolio managers may sell a security when the investment adviser\\'s price objective is reached, the fundamentals of the investment change or to pursue more attractive investment options. A security will also be sold (in accordance with the Calvert Balanced Fund2Summary Prospectus dated February 1, 2023 investment adviser\\'s guidelines and at a time and in a manner that is determined to be in the best interests of shareholders) if the investment adviser determines that the issuer does not operate in a manner consistent with the Fund\\'s responsible investment criteria. The portfolio managers may also use rotation and absolute return strategies in their management of the fixed-income portion of the Fund. The investment adviser manages duration and any hedging of interest rate risk in the fixed-income portion of the Fund through the purchase and sale of U.S. Treasury securities and related futures contracts. This Fund does not have a specific target for its average fund duration and may invest in bonds and other fixed-income instruments of any maturity. Incidental to its main investment strategy, the Fund may also use derivatives as a substitute for direct investment in a particular asset class, in order to facilitate the periodic rebalancing of the Fund\\'s portfolio to maintain its target asset allocation, to make tactical asset allocations, to hedge foreign currency exposure, and to assist in managing cash. The Fund may also lend its securities. Responsible Investing. The portfolio manager(s) seek to invest in companies that manage environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") risk exposures adequately and that are not exposed to excessive ESG risk through their principal business activities. Companies are analyzed by the investment adviser\\'s ESG analysts utilizing The Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment (\"Principles\"), a framework for considering ESG factors (a copy of which is included as an appendix to the Fund\\'s Prospectus). Each company is evaluated relative to an appropriate peer group based on material ESG factors as determined by the investment adviser. Pursuant to the Principles, the investment adviser seeks to identify companies and other issuers that operate in a manner that is consistent with or promotes environmental sustainability and resource efficiency, equitable societies and respect for human rights, and accountable governance and transparency. The Fund generally invests in issuers that are believed by the investment adviser to operate in accordance with the Principles and may also invest in issuers that the investment adviser believes are likely to operate in accordance with the Principles pending the investment adviser\\'s engagement activity with such issuer.'},\n",

       "  'strategy': \"To pursue its goal, the Fund invests in a concentrated portfolio, consisting mainly of common stocks of companies that are selected using a fundamental, bottom-up research approach. The Fund may hold stocks of companies of any market capitalization and in any sector. Under normal market conditions, the Fund typically will hold a limited number of stocks. Portfolio construction is an important component of the investment process and primarily consists of three distinct investment categories: Special Situations, Opportunistic, and Classic. Special Situations have unique attributes (e.g., restructurings, spin-offs, post-bankruptcy equities) that require specific methodologies and customized investment research. Opportunistic investments are companies that have become inexpensive for a tangible reason that the Portfolio Manager believes is temporary. Classic investments are those companies with long histories of shareholder-friendly policies, high-quality management teams and consistent operating performance. The Portfolio Manager performs both quantitative and qualitative analysis in an effort to identify companies that he believes have the potential to increase in value. This potential may be realized in many ways, some of which include: free cash flow generation, product or process enhancements, margin increases, and improved capital structure management. Investments are selected primarily based on fundamental analysis of issuers and their potential in light of their financial condition, industry position, market opportunities, senior management teams and any special situations as well as any relevant economic, political and regulatory factors. The Portfolio Manager systematically and explicitly includes material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and opportunities in investment analysis and investment decisions for all securities to help identify high quality securities. The Portfolio Manager conducts ongoing proprietary ESG research, including proactive engagement on ESG issues. The Portfolio Manager assesses all securities in relation to their exposure to and the management of material ESG risks. The Portfolio Manager employs disciplined valuation criteria and dynamic price limits to determine when to buy or sell a stock. The valuation criteria and price limits will change over time as a result of changes in company-specific, industry and market factors. The Portfolio Manager follows a disciplined selling strategy and may sell a stock when it reaches a dynamic price target, when other opportunities appear more attractive, or when the Portfolio Manager's research indicates deteriorating fundamentals. Although the Fund invests primarily in domestic stocks, it may also invest in stocks of foreign companies. At times, the Portfolio Manager may emphasize certain sectors that he believes will benefit from market or economic trends.\"},\n",

ESG Integration: As part of the investment decision making process for the Fund, the Adviser evaluates how financially material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors may affect a security\\'s revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and overall risk. The consideration of ESG factors in investment decision-making is referred to as \"ESG integration\". The Adviser considers \"financial materiality\" as it is understood in generally accepted accounting principles - information that would influence the judgment of an informed investor. In addition, the Adviser utilizes active ownership strategies to encourage sustainable business policies and practices (e.g., effective climate risk management) and greater ESG transparency (e.g., good disclosure of salient ESG risk and opportunities). Active ownership strategies include communicating directly with company management teams or boards; filing proposals for vote at company annual general meetings; voting on ballot items in company proxy statements; and engaging public policymakers. ESG Screening: While the Adviser integrates ESG factors into its investment decision-making, the Fund is also subject to ESG screening criteria. ESG screening criteria requires the Adviser to exclude securities with significant exposure to specific products or services: alcohol production; coal mining; factory farming; gambling; handguns; nuclear power fuel cycle; prison operations; tobacco manufacturing; weapons systems; and fossil fuels. The www.bostontrustwalden.com May 1, 2022 Boston Trust Walden SMID Cap Fund (WASMX) Fund Summary Adviser assesses the security\\'s revenue dependence on these specific products/services, market share (e.g., if a company is a market leader in the product despite it representing a relatively small share of the company\\'s total revenue), and severity (e.g., the company produces a minor electronic input for a weapons system). The Adviser also exercises its full discretion in evaluating the overall performance of each security. The Adviser considers: performance over time (relative to peers and established goals); accountability and disclosure; and impacts on stakeholders. For each potential investment, the Adviser seeks to understand the company\\'s products and services and evaluates overall performance in four broad categories: corporate governance, human capital management, environmental impacts, and community impacts.

The Fund attempts to achieve investment results that reflect the return of the U.S. stock market as represented by its benchmark index, the Russell 3000  Index, while taking into consideration certain ESG criteria, which include additional criteria relating to carbon emissions and fossil fuel reserves. See \"Additional information about the Fund\\'s benchmark index\" in the non-summary portion of the Prospectus for more information about the Fund\\'s benchmark. For purposes of the 80% investment policy, the term \"assets\" means net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes. When selecting investments for the Fund, Teachers Advisors, LLC (\"Advisors\"), the Fund\\'s investment adviser, considers certain ESG criteria. The ESG criteria are generally implemented based on data provided by independent research vendor(s). The evaluation process favors companies with leadership in ESG performance relative to their peers. Typically, environmental assessment categories include climate change, natural resource use, waste management and environmental opportunities. Social evaluation categories include human capital, product safety and social opportunities. Governance assessment categories include corporate governance, business ethics and government and public policy. How well companies adhere to international norms and principles and involvement in major ESG controversies (examples of which may relate to the environment, customers, human rights and community, labor rights and supply chain, and governance) are other considerations. The ESG evaluation process is conducted on an industry-specific basis and involves the identification of key performance indicators, which are given more or less relative weight compared to the broader range of potential assessment categories. When ESG concerns exist, the evaluation process gives careful consideration to how companies address the risks and opportunities they face in TIAA-CREF Social Choice Low Carbon Equity Fund ■ Summary Prospectus 3 the context of their sector or industry and relative to their peers. The Fund will not generally invest in companies significantly involved in certain business activities, including but not limited to the production of alcohol, tobacco, military weapons, firearms, nuclear power, thermal coal and gambling products and services. In addition to the overall ESG performance evaluation, the Fund favors companies that (1) demonstrate leadership in managing and mitigating their current carbon emissions and (2) do not have evidence of fossil fuel reserves ownership, regardless of industry. The determination of leadership criteria takes into consideration company carbon emissions both in absolute terms (e.g., tons of carbon emitted directly into the atmosphere) and in relative terms (e.g., tons of carbon emitted per unit of economic output such as sales). Reserves are fossil fuel deposits that have not yet been extracted. Evidence of fossil fuel reserves ownership includes company disclosure and statements regarding ownership. After the ESG evaluation process is conducted, Advisors then uses quantitative investment techniques to attempt to closely match, to the extent practicable, the overall risk characteristics of the benchmark index. Under these quantitative investment techniques, the Fund uses a risk model to evaluate the stocks in which the Fund may invest and to inform the construction of a broadly diversified group of stocks. While Advisors generally invests in companies that meet the ESG criteria, it is not required to invest in every company that meets these criteria. In addition, concerns with respect to one ESG assessment category may not automatically eliminate an issuer from being considered an eligible Fund investment. The ESG criteria the Fund takes into consideration are non-fundamental investment policies and may be changed without the approval of the Fund\\'s shareholders. The Board of Trustees of the Trust or a designated committee thereof (\"Board of Trustees\") reviews the ESG criteria used to evaluate securities held by the Fund and the ESG vendor(s) that provide the data that help inform these criteria. Subject to Board review, Advisors has the right to change the ESG vendor(s) at any time and to add to the number of vendors providing the ESG data. Investing on the basis of ESG criteria is qualitative and subjective by nature. There can be no assurance that every Fund investment will meet ESG criteria, or will do so at all times, or that the ESG criteria or any judgement exercised by Advisors will reflect the beliefs or values of any particular investor. The Fund is not restricted from investing in any securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities.

As of February 28, 2023, the duration of the benchmark was 6.26 years. The average duration of debt securities in the Fund\\'s portfolio may, however, be shorter or longer depending on market conditions. The Fund may invest in debt securities issued by any of the following: public and private U.S. and non-U.S. companies; the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank; state and local governments issuing taxable municipal securities; and governments, government agencies, authorities or instrumentalities and supra-national organizations in foreign countries, including emerging markets.

GW&K may adjust its assessment of an investment based on a number of considerations. GW&K applies its ESG factor analysis as one element of the investment process when selecting debt securities issued by public and private companies, including corporate bonds and preferred securities, state and local governments issuing taxable municipal securities, and bonds whose proceeds are reserved for financing the implementation of the United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals or other sustainable projects, but not when selecting debt securities issued by other types of issuers, including but not limited to asset-backed and mortgage-backed debt securities, ETFs, TIPS, non-U.S. dollar-dominated instruments, and securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, and governments, government agencies, authorities or instrumentalities and supra-national organizations in foreign countries. GW&K has created its own proprietary ESG Scoring System, which takes into consideration a range of factors, including independent analysis from third parties such as MSCI Inc. and Sustainalytics, as well as its own analysis of material ESG factors. Each of GW&K\\'s sector specialists generally assesses the materiality of relevant environmental, social and governance metrics to bond issues during the fundamental research process, depending on the sector and for corporate issuers the nature of the company\\'s business. GW&K uses standards developed by the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board to inform these assessments. Environmental assessment may take into account issues such as carbon emissions, natural resource usage, hazardous waste, chemical safety, water stress and sustainable technology. Social assessment may take into account issues such as human rights, labor relations, employee safety, product safety, data security and community relations. Governance assessment may take into account issues such as business ethics, board quality, board composition, compensation practices, financial reporting and stakeholder governance. GW&K recognizes that the relative impact of ESG factors on investment performance may vary across market sector, industries and regions, but the firm believes that responsible corporate behavior with respect to ESG factors can contribute to positive and sustainable long-term financial performance. GW&K seeks to identify issuers that GW&K believes are leaders in their industries in effectively addressing exposure to ESG risks through business practices, policies and programs, or issuers within an industry that have more limited exposure to ESG risks.

The Fund considers securities of U.S. companies to be those that (1) are traded principally on a stock exchange or over-the-counter in the United States, (2) are organized under the laws of and/or have a principal office in the United States, or (3) derive 50% or more of their total revenues from, and/or have 50% or more of their total assets in, goods produced, sales made, profits generated or services performed in the United States. Companies are selected using a fundamental, bottom-up research approach and proprietary in-depth Impact analysis using quantitative ratios and qualitative scoring frameworks. The Fund may hold stocks of companies of any market capitalization and in any sector. Under normal market conditions, the Fund typically will hold a limited number of stocks. The Portfolio Managers focus on both social and environmental Impact themes while also integrating governance factors into the investment process. Social themes include a company\\'s ability to deliver sustainable growth and fair employment, increase positive health and safety outcomes, and promote gender and racial equality. Environmental themes include the ability to combat climate change, enable energy transitions, and conserve the natural environment. Portfolio construction is an important component of the investment process and primarily consists of three distinct investment categories: Special Situations, Opportunistic, and Impact Leaders. Special Situations have certain attributes that the Portfolio Managers believe may influence Impact outcomes (e.g., initial public offerings, spin-offs, private investments, changes in capital structure, mergers and acquisitions) and require specific methodologies and customized investment research. Opportunistic investments are companies that the Portfolio Managers believe are temporarily underappreciated by the broader market, given their long- term business and/or Impact potential. Impact Leaders are those companies with a track record of significant Impact, shareholder-oriented management, superior competitive positioning, or that are industry leaders in environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") issues. The Portfolio Managers utilize an integrated approach focused on rigorous Impact analysis, consideration of ESG factors, and assessment of company financials. The Managers perform both quantitative and qualitative analysis in an effort to identify companies that they believe have the potential to increase in value. This potential may be realized in many ways, some of which include: free cash flow generation, product or process enhancements, margin increases, and improved capital structure management. Investments are selected primarily based on fundamental analysis of issuers and their potential in light of the Portfolio Managers\\' evaluation of their financial condition, industry position, market opportunities, Impact metrics, ESG factors, senior management teams and any special situations as well as any relevant economic, political and regulatory factors. Environmental and social outcomes will be evaluated on an absolute basis, with the goal of achieving a specific and identifiable positive threshold. Additionally, the contribution of companies to a specific environmental or social outcome will be compared against other companies, which also contribute to that same environmental or social outcome. These factors will be considered both individually and collectively, as part of the Portfolio Managers\\' analysis. 2 NEUBERGER BERMAN U.S. EQUITY IMPACT FUNDDecember 18, 2023 The Portfolio Managers will invest in accordance with the Fund\\'s Enhanced Sustainable Exclusion Policy. The policy describes businesses, which may be deemed controversial, and are therefore excluded from investment consideration. Please see the Statement of Additional Information for a detailed description of the Fund\\'s Enhanced Sustainable Exclusion Criteria. The Portfolio Managers employ disciplined valuation criteria and dynamic price limits to determine when to buy or sell a security. The valuation criteria and price limits will change over time as a result of changes in company-specific, industry and market factors. The Portfolio Managers follow a disciplined selling strategy and may sell a security when it reaches a dynamic price target, when other opportunities appear more attractive, when Impact metrics deteriorate, or when the Portfolio Managers\\' research indicates declining fundamentals.

Normally, the Fund\\'s investments will consist of approximately 60% equity securities and 40% fixed-income securities, but these target allocations may vary. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will not deviate more than 10% from each target allocation. The Fund will not purchase a security if as a S-2 result less than 25% of its total assets would be invested in either equity securities or fixed-income securities. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund\\'s net assets will be invested in securities of issuers that meet the Fund\\'s sustainability criteria, as described below. In its equity investments, the Fund pursues opportunistic growth by investing primarily in a portfolio of U.S. companies whose business activities the Adviser believes position the company to benefit from certain environmentally- or socially-oriented sustainable investment themes that align with one or more of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (\"SDGs\"). These themes principally include the advancement of health, climate, and empowerment. A company that derives at least 25% of its total revenues from activities consistent with the achievement of the SDGs meets the Fund\\'s sustainability criteria, although many of the companies in which the Fund invests will derive a much greater portion of their revenues from such activities. The Adviser normally considers a universe of primarily U.S. mid- to large-capitalization companies for investment. The Adviser employs a combination of \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" investment processes with the goal of identifying, based on its internal research and analysis, the most attractive U.S. equity securities that fit into sustainable investment themes. First, under the \"top-down\" approach, the Adviser identifies the sustainable investment themes. In addition to this \"top-down\" thematic approach, the Adviser then uses a \"bottom-up\" analysis of individual companies that focuses on prospective earnings growth, valuation and quality of company management and on evaluating a company\\'s risks, including those related to environmental, social, and corporate governance (\"ESG\") factors. ESG factors, which can vary across companies and industries, may include environmental impact, corporate governance, ethical business practices, diversity and employee practices, product safety, supply chain management and community impact. Eligible investments include securities of issuers that the Adviser believes will maximize total return while also contributing to positive societal impact aligned with one or more SDGs. While the Adviser emphasizes focusing on individual companies with favorable ESG attributes over the use of broad-based negative screens (e.g., disqualifying business activities) in assessing an issuer\\'s exposure to ESG factors, the Fund will not invest in issuers of equity securities that derive revenue from direct involvement in alcohol, coal, gambling, pornography, prisons, tobacco or weapons. The Fund\\'s fixed-income securities will consist predominantly of U.S. Government and agency securities, which must meet the Fund\\'s sustainability and ESG criteria for government securities. In this regard, the Adviser evaluates government securities based on the alignment of the nation\\'s policies with the SDGs and an internal scoring system that considers the nation\\'s policies on ESG issues. The Fund expects to use derivatives, such as options, futures contracts, forwards and swaps. Derivatives may provide more efficient and economical exposure to market segments than direct investments, and may also be a more efficient way to alter the Fund\\'s exposures than making direct investments. For example, the Fund may use bond futures contracts and interest rate swaps to gain and adjust its exposures to the fixed-income markets.'},\n",

       "  'strategy': 'The Credit Opportunities Fund seeks to achieve its objective by allocating the Fund\\'s assets among various credit sectors of the global fixed income markets which the Advisor finds attractive from time-to-time. When allocating assets into these various credit segments, the Advisor seeks to take advantage of the potential differences in return expectations over the course of a full market cycle which may arise as these different credit sectors move in and out of favor. In seeking to achieve the Fund\\'s objective, the Advisor constructs the Fund\\'s portfolio targeting an average annual return over a full market cycle that meaningfully exceeds LIBOR (or future market replacement for LIBOR) within a volatility-managed framework. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will be able to provide such returns and you may lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund pursues a \"go-anywhere\" strategy within the credit markets and will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets in corporate bonds and syndicated loans, including floating rate loans, that the Advisor believes have attractive risk/reward characteristics and which are issued by U.S. and foreign corporations. Syndicated loans represent amounts borrowed by companies or other entities. In many cases, they are issued in connection with recapitalizations, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and refinancings. A syndicated loan typically has priority with respect to payment (to the extent assets are available) in the event of bankruptcy. The Fund generally will acquire syndicated loans as assignments from lenders. These syndicated loans have interest rates that reset periodically (annually or more frequently), generally based on a common interest rate index. The Fund invests in both investment grade rated bonds as well as below-investment grade bonds (or \"junk\") bonds. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in below-investment grade bonds rated below B- /B3 (at the time of purchase) by S&P Global Ratings (\"Standard & Poor\\'s\"), Fitch Ratings Inc. (\"Fitch\") or Moody\\'s Investor Services, Inc. (\"Moody\\'s\"), as applicable, or which are deemed equivalent by the Advisor. However, up to 100% of the Fund may be invested in bonds that are rated below-investment grade or Advisor-rated at any time. The Fund will typically not purchase bonds that are in default. The Fund\\'s investments may be unsecured or backed by receivables or other assets. The Fund may invest up to 70% of its net assets in foreign securities, including up to 40% in issuers located in emerging market countries. As this is a credit-focused fund, investments may also include asset-backed securities (\"ABS\") including mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") and securities backed by other forms of loans or securities. The Fund may invest (up to 80% of its net assets) in mutual funds (including affiliated mutual funds), and/or exchange-traded funds (\"ETFs\") which invest principally in any of the previously mentioned types of fixed income securities and such investments in fixed income mutual funds and ETFs will be included in the Fund\\'s 80% test. The mutual funds and ETFs in which the Fund invests have an investment objective similar to that of the Fund or are otherwise permitted investments in accordance with the Fund\\'s investment policies described herein. There are three major components to the Advisor\\'s investment decision making process: (i) the determination of the appropriate asset allocation across the credit spectrum as well as desired geographical diversification, (ii) selection of individual investments for the Fund, and (iii) portfolio risk management. In the first two components, the Advisor\\'s Asset Allocation Group develops target top-down tactical allocation ranges. The portfolio managers then make the final allocation decision regarding the approximate percentage of the Fund that will be invested in each fixed income credit sector (for example higher rated bonds vs. lower rated bonds), and within and across geographies (for example, emerging markets vs. U.S. bonds). The portfolio managers then select investments based on a bottom-up fundamental analysis/evaluation of potential investment opportunities. In the third component, the Advisor may manage and adjust overall portfolio duration and credit risk exposure by the strategic use of derivatives that are primarily used to reduce portfolio volatility. The Advisor expects to principally use credit index derivatives or options thereon (both long and short) and/or futures and options on primarily U.S. Treasuries to shorten or extend portfolio duration and credit spread sensitivity. The Advisor focuses on risk management from a long-term perspective, rather than being reactive to intermittent periods of market volatility, thus allowing portfolio management to focus on long-term investing. The Fund may use derivatives in various ways. The Fund may use derivatives as a substitute for taking a long or short position in the reference asset or to gain exposure to certain asset classes; under such circumstances, the derivatives may have economic characteristics similar to those of the reference asset, and the Fund\\'s investment in the derivatives may be applied toward meeting a requirement to invest a certain percentage of its net assets in instruments with such characteristics. The Fund may use derivatives to hedge (or reduce) its exposure to a portfolio asset or risk. The Fund may also use derivatives to manage cash. By investing in derivatives, the Fund attempts to achieve the economic equivalence it would achieve if it were to invest directly in the underlying security. 2To mitigate the counterparty risk resulting from swap transactions, the Fund will only enter into swap transactions with highly rated financial institutions specializing in this type of transaction and in accordance with the standard terms laid down by the International Securities Dealers Association. Although the Advisor will consider ratings assigned by ratings agencies in selecting investments, it relies principally on its own research and investment analysis. As applicable, the Advisor considers company-specific quantitative and qualitative factors such as: a company\\'s managerial strength and commitment to debt repayment, anticipated cash flow, debt maturity schedules, borrowing requirements, use of borrowing proceeds, asset coverage and earnings prospects; legislation, regulation, litigation, transparency, market perspective, or other environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks; and the strength and depth of the protections afforded the lender through the documentation governing the bond or syndicated loan issuance. The types of ESG factors that the Advisor believes can impact financial risks derive from, among other issues: changes to regulations, changes to consumer preferences, technology advancements, climate impacts, litigation risks, efficiency, brand value, innovation, market disruption/obsolescence, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, anti-bribery matters, and social license to operate. As a result of considering ESG factors in the Advisor\\'s investment decision process, an investment may be excluded or rejected where Muzinich believes those factors imply heightened risk of decreased liquidity of an investment and/or other negative financial impacts. In line with this, securities ineligible for investment by the Norges Bank Investment Management Company are also ineligible for inclusion in the Fund. The Advisor does not manage the Fund to any particular duration. Rather, depending on the mix of securities within the Fund\\'s portfolio and market conditions, the portfolio\\'s average duration may change. The average duration-to-worst is anticipated to fall most often between zero and five years, with a concentration toward the middle of that range, but could be shortened or extended. (Duration-to-worst is a measure of the expected life of a fixed income security that is used to determine the sensitivity of a security\\'s price to changes in interest rates.) In general, the longer the duration of the Fund\\'s bonds and/or loans, the greater the likelihood that an increase in interest rates would cause a decline in the price of the Fund\\'s shares. In constructing the Fund\\'s portfolio, the Advisor pays close attention to the overall liquidity of the Fund\\'s portfolio. The Advisor seeks to maintain a liquid portfolio. Under certain circumstances, particularly in difficult market environments, this may cause the Advisor to avoid certain investments whose liquidity might be challenged in those markets. The portfolio is actively managed and the Fund may sell a holding when it has already met or no longer meets the portfolio managers\\' expectations, no longer offers compelling relative value, shows deteriorating fundamentals, or if it falls short of the portfolio managers\\' expectations. Trading securities frequently may lead to high portfolio turnover. Tax consequences are not a primary consideration in the Fund\\'s investment decisions. The Fund may also sell holdings as a result of a change in the tactical asset allocation. Although the Fund will typically not purchase bonds or loans that are already in default, the portfolio managers may decide to continue to hold a bond or loan (or related securities) after a default. There is no limit on the amount of defaulted securities the Fund may hold.'},\n",

The fund may also invest in companies that the subadviser believes are making substantial progress toward becoming a leader in sustainability and ESG policies. ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Fund 3 Determination of sustainability/ESG leadership is based on the subadviser\\'s proprietary research approach. The subadviser will exercise judgment to determine ESG best practices based on its long standing experience managing ESG investment strategies through an established proprietary process. Leadership may be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively, through the subadviser\\'s ESG ratings system and direct research and engagement process. The ESG and sustainability evaluation is integrated into a thorough assessment of investment worthiness based on financial criteria. The subadviser seeks to invest over the long term in companies that are considered to be of high quality with sustainable competitive advantages as evidenced by high returns on capital, strong balance sheets, and capable management teams that allocate capital in an efficient manner. The subadviser will also consider emerging companies with promising future prospects that may not yet have demonstrated substantial profitability. The subadviser will utilize quantitative and fundamental analysis to identify investment candidates with these attributes, and evaluate industry dynamics, the strength of the business model and management skill. Valuation will be carefully examined using a variety of techniques that depend on the type of company being researched. Methods typically used are discounted cash flow analysis, market implied growth and returns relative to the subadviser\\'s expectations, multiple comparisons and scenario analysis. A sustainable company, in the subadviser\\'s view, is one that (1) offers products and services that have a positive impact on society (as described below) and (2) has well defined strategies in place to ensure longevity as an investment. The subadviser seeks to invest in companies that go beyond doing less harm to people and the planet relative to its peers, but also, in many cases, offer solutions to address negative impact from the actions of less responsible companies and industries. Further, sustainability is not limited to environmental stewardship, but also includes a company\\'s policies in regard to treating employees fairly and furthering their professional development, interacting in a positive way within its local community, promoting safety at all times, managing its supply chain responsibly, and employing corporate governance practices that are shareholder friendly and transparent. The subadviser will seek to limit its investments to only those companies whose overall ESG profile it judges to be very strong. It is also the subadviser\\'s intention to engage and encourage management to improve in certain ESG areas identified by the subadviser. Leadership ESG characteristics and weightings are determined by sector, but also share common traits such as transparency, management involvement, innovation, long-term view, and willingness to engage investors on sustainability matters. Leadership, in the subadviser\\'s view, is associated with a company that is showing evidence of best practices of ESG policies within its given sector or industry. The subadviser may also identify potential investments in companies that have attractive early leadership qualities based on proprietary research. The portfolio managers will exercise their judgment in applying the ESG ratings system. The fund will not invest in companies with significant direct involvement in extraction of fossil fuels and mining, and instead will seek other attractive sustainable opportunities in the energy, industrials, and materials sectors. Direct involvement in fossil-fuel extraction and mining would be inclusive of companies that derive revenues primarily from: extraction and/or burning of coal; mining of metals or minerals; exploration and production of oil and gas; and refining of fossil fuels. The fund may invest in companies that provide equipment and services to the energy and mining sectors. 4 ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Fund The subadviser will sell a security if the issuer no longer meets its ESG and financial criteria. In addition, the subadviser will seek to replace securities when the company\\'s risk/reward profile is no longer favorable due to price appreciation or if the company\\'s investment fundamentals have deteriorated meaningfully relative to original expectations. Securities may also be sold to permit investment in an issuer considered by the subadviser to be a more attractive alternative.

Generally, the Fund intends to invest in bonds issued by both domestic and foreign issuers; including foreign issuers from emerging market countries.

The Fund\\'s overall design and investment strategy centers on rigorous and independent research analysis to help identify bonds with both favorable yields and compelling relative value, and the potential for positive environmental impact as it relates to each respective issuer\\'s and/or individual TIAA-CREF Green Bond Fund ■ Summary Prospectus 3 project\\'s use of proceeds. These investments provide access to the following environmental themes: (1) renewable energy and climate change (renewable energy projects, smart grid and other projects designed to make generation and transmission systems more efficient, and other projects which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions); and (2) natural resources (land conservation, sustainable forestry and agriculture, remediation and redevelopment of polluted or contaminated sites, sustainable waste management projects, water infrastructure and other sustainable building projects). Advisors engages with certain issuers of investments deemed by Advisors to represent impact securities to communicate impact reporting preferences and encourage alignment with industry best practices regarding responsible investment.The Board of Trustees of the Trust or a designated committee thereof (\"Board of Trustees\") periodically reviews the Impact framework used to evaluate securities held by the Fund. Advisors seeks to ensure that the substantial majority of the Fund\\'s investments are consistent with its Impact framework, but Advisors cannot guarantee that this will always be the case for every Fund investment. Investing on the basis of the Fund\\'s Impact framework is qualitative and subjective by nature. There can be no assurance that every Fund investment will meet the Impact framework, or will do so at all times, or that the Impact framework or any judgment exercised by Advisors will reflect the beliefs or values of any particular investor.The Fund is actively managed and does not rely exclusively on rating agencies when making investment decisions. Instead, Advisors performs its own credit analysis, paying particular attention to economic trends and other market events. Subject to the Impact framework described above, individual securities or sectors may be overweighted or underweighted relative to the Fund\\'s benchmark index when Advisors believes that the Fund can boost returns above that of the index. The Fund is not restricted from investing in any securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities. Advisors considers investments in these securities to be consistent with the Fund\\'s Impact framework. The Fund also invests in certain asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that represent interests in assets such as, but not limited to, pools of mortgage loans, automobile loans or credit card receivables. These securities are typically issued by legal entities established specifically to hold assets and to issue debt obligations backed by those assets. Asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities are normally created or \"sponsored\" by banks or other institutions or by certain government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Advisors does not take into consideration whether the sponsor of an asset-backed security in which the Fund invests meets the Impact framework.

The average portfolio duration of this Fund normally varies within two years (plus or minus) of the portfolio duration of the securities comprising the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, as calculated by PIMCO, which as of May 31, 2020 was 5.75 years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security\\'s price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security\\'s duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. The Fund will not invest in the securities of any non-governmental issuer determined by PIMCO to be engaged principally in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products or military equipment, the operation of gambling casinos, the production or trade of pornographic materials, or in the oil industry, including extraction, production, and refining or the production, distribution of coal and coal fired generation. The Fund can invest in the securities of any issuer determined by PIMCO to be engaged principally in biofuel production, natural gas generation and sales and trading activities. However, green/sustainable bonds from issuers involved in fossil fuel-related sectors may be permitted. Labeled green bonds are those issues with proceeds specifically earmarked to be used for climate and environmental projects. Labeled green bonds are often verified by a third party, which certifies that the bond will fund projects that include environmental benefits. In addition, the Fund will not invest in the securities of any non-governmental issuer determined by PIMCO to be engaged principally in the provision of healthcare services or the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, unless the issuer derives 100% of its gross revenues from products or services designed to protect and improve the quality of human life, as determined on the basis of information available to PIMCO. To the extent possible on the basis of information available to PIMCO, an issuer will be deemed to be principally engaged in an activity if it derives more than 10% of its gross revenues from such activities. In analyzing whether an issuer meets any of the criteria described above, PIMCO may rely upon, among other things, information provided by an independent third party. The Fund may avoid investment in the securities of issuers whose business practices with respect to the environment, social responsibility, and governance (\"ESG practices\") are not to PIMCO\\'s satisfaction. In determining the efficacy of an issuer\\'s ESG practices, PIMCO will use its own proprietary assessments of material ESG issues and may also reference standards as set forth by recognized global organizations such as entities sponsored by the United Nations. Additionally, PIMCO may engage proactively with issuers to encourage them to improve their ESG practices. PIMCO\\'s activities in this respect may include, but are not limited to, direct dialogue with company management, such as through in-person meetings, phone calls, electronic communications, and letters. Through these engagement activities, PIMCO seeks to identify opportunities for a company to improve its ESG practices, and will endeavor to work collaboratively with company management to establish concrete objectives and to develop a plan for meeting these objectives. The Fund may invest in securities of issuers whose ESG practices are currently suboptimal, with the expectation that these practices may improve over time either as a result of PIMCO\\'s engagement efforts or through the company\\'s own initiatives. It may also exclude those issuers that are not receptive to PIMCO\\'s engagement efforts, as determined in PIMCO\\'s sole discretion. The Fund invests primarily in investment grade securities, but may invest up to 20% of its total assets in high yield securities (\"junk bonds\"), as rated by Moody\\'s Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody\\'s\"), Standard & Poor\\'s Ratings Services (\"S&P\") or Fitch, Inc. (\"Fitch\"), or, if unrated, as determined by PIMCO. In the event that ratings services assign different ratings to the same security, PIMCO will use the highest rating as the credit rating for that security. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its total assets in securities denominated in foreign currencies, and may invest beyond this limit in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to emerging market countries (this limitation does not apply to investment grade sovereign debt denominated in the local currency with less than 1 year remaining to maturity, which means the Fund may invest, together with any other investments denominated in foreign currencies, up to 30% of its total assets in such instruments). The Fund will normally limit its foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities or currencies) to 20% of its total assets. The Fund may invest, without limitation, in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, or in mortgage- or asset-backed securities, subject to applicable law and any other restrictions described in the Fund\\'s prospectus or Statement of Additional Information. The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls). The \"total return\" sought by the Fund consists of income earned on the Fund\\'s investments, plus capital appreciation, if any, which generally arises from decreases in interest rates, foreign currency appreciation, or improving credit fundamentals for a particular sector or security.

Primary categories of the energy value chain include the following: • Energy Companies (Supply-side oriented) – Companies across the energy supply chain spectrum, including upstream, midstream, and downstream energy companies of various energy sources such as natural gas, crude oil, refined products, coal, and electricity, as well as companies that provide services to oil and gas companies. • Industrial Companies – Energy-intensive chemical, metal, industrial, and manufacturing companies and engineering and construction companies that the Portfolio Managers expect to benefit from growing U.S. energy production and lower feedstock costs relative to global costs. • Infrastructure Companies – Companies that design, manufacture, install, own, operate, or service equipment or assets that enable the connectivity of energy supply and demand or provide technology and engineering solutions to industrial, commercial, and consumer markets. Examples include (1) a manufacturer of liquefied natural gas products for locomotives powered by natural gas, (2) a manufacturer of engines that primarily use natural gas and alternative fuels to power school buses and refuse collection trucks, and (3) a specialty energy infrastructure contractor that provides engineering, procurement, and construction services to the oil, gas, refinery, petrochemical, and power industries. • Transportation and Logistics Companies – Companies that provide solutions for transportation and logistics to the U.S. manufacturing industry, such as trucking, railroads, and airlines. The Fund invests primarily in common stocks and invests without regard to market capitalization. The Fund may also invest up to 25% of its total assets in securities of energy-related master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\"). In addition to the principal strategies discussed above, the Fund may also invest in preferred stocks, warrants, options, equity-like instruments, and debt instruments.

The Fund considers an issuer\\'s \"primary operations\" to be in a foreign market if the issuer (i) is organized under the laws of that country, or (ii) derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from goods produced or sold, investments made, services performed, or has at least 50% of its assets located within that country. The Fund may also invest, as a principal strategy, up to 25% of its net assets in GRSI companies organized as master limited partnerships (\"MLPs\").

The circular economy concept (i) recognizes the importance of a sustainable economic system and represents an alternative economic model to the default \"make-use-throw away\" approach of consumption, which is believed to be unsustainable given scarce resources and the rising cost of managing waste, and (ii) promotes the redesign of products and systems to minimize waste and to enable greater recycling and reuse of materials. GRSI companies are primarily focused in these areas. The Fund will not invest in issuers that do not meet this definition.

Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC, (\"PSG\" or the \"Adviser\") serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser utilizes a fundamental, bottom-up, value-based selection methodology, taking into account short-term considerations, such as temporary market mispricing, and long-term considerations, such as values of assets and cash flows. The Adviser also draws upon the expertise and knowledge within Brookfield Asset Management ULC and its affiliates, which provide extensive owner/operator insights into industry drivers and trends. The Adviser takes a balanced approach to investing, seeking to mitigate risk through diversification, credit analysis, economic analysis and review of sector and industry trends. The Adviser uses proprietary research to select individual securities that it believes can add value from income and/or the potential for capital appreciation. The proprietary research may include an assessment of a company\\'s general financial condition, its competitive positioning and management strength, as well as industry characteristics and other factors. The Fund may sell a security that becomes overvalued or no longer offers an attractive \\u200b \\u200b risk/reward profile. A security may also be sold due to changes in portfolio strategy or cash flow needs. The allocation of capital across asset classes and strategies will vary upon market opportunity and other factors.

When deemed by the investment adviser to be relevant to its evaluation of creditworthiness and when applicable information is available, the investment adviser considers environmental, social and/or governance issues (referred to as ESG) which may impact the prospects of an issuer (or obligor) or financial performance of an obligation. When considered, one or more ESG issues are taken into account alongside other factors in the investment decision-making process and are not the sole determinant of whether an investment can be made or will remain in the Fund\\'s portfolio.

SUMMARY PROSPECTUS JANUARY 31, 2012 1 The Fund invests in a combination of stocks, bonds and money market instruments in an attempt to provide a complete investment portfolio in a single product. The Advisor monitors the Fund\\'s allocation and may rebalance or reallocate the Fund\\'s assets based on its view of economic and market factors and events. The equity portion of the Fund is primarily a large cap core U.S. domestic portfolio, although the Fund may also invest in foreign stocks and mid-cap stocks. The equity portion of the Fund seeks companies that have the potential to outperform the market through exceptional growth and/or valuation improvement. The fixed-income portion of the Fund reflects an active trading strategy, seeking total return. The Fund uses a hedging technique that includes the purchase and sale of U.S. Treasury securities and related futures contracts to manage the duration of the Fund. The Fund may also use futures contracts as a substitute for direct investment in a particular asset class, in order to facilitate the periodic rebalancing of the Fund\\'s portfolio to maintain its target asset allocation, to make tactical asset allocations and to assist in managing cash. The Subadvisors select the equity investments, while the Advisor manages the fixed-income assets and determines the overall asset class mix for the Fund depending upon its view of market conditions and economic outlook. Sustainable and Socially Responsible Investing. The Fund seeks to invest in companies and other enterprises that demonstrate positive environmental, social and governance performance as they address corporate responsibility and sustainability challenges. Calvert believes that there are long-term benefits in an investment philosophy that attaches material weight to the environment, workplace relations, human rights, Indigenous Peoples\\' rights, community relations, product safety and impact, and corporate governance and business ethics. Calvert also believes that managing risks and opportunities related to these issues can contribute positively to company performance as well as to investment performance over time. The Fund has sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria that reflect specific types of companies in which the Fund seeks to invest and seeks to avoid investing. Investments are first selected for financial soundness and then evaluated according to the Fund\\'s sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria. Investments must be consistent with the Fund\\'s current investment criteria, including financial, sustainability and social responsibility factors, the application of which is in the economic interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

In selecting a diversified portfolio of underlying funds, the Adviser analyzes many factors, including the underlying funds\\' investment objectives, total return, and volatility. The Portfolio may also invest in other mutual funds or exchange traded funds (\"ETFs\") to gain exposure to unique investment characteristics not available in the underlying Praxis Funds and whose screening criteria may differ from the Praxis core stewardship investing guidelines.

       "  'strategy': \"To achieve its investment objective, the Fund invests in, or seeks exposure to, companies based on various financial factors and fundamental sustainability factors such as environmental, social and governance performance of such companies. The Fund invests in equity securities, which include, but are not limited to, dividend-paying securities, common stock, preferred stock, shares of investment companies, convertible securities, warrants and rights. The Fund may, but is not required to, use exchange-traded derivative instruments for risk management purposes or as part of the Fund's investment strategies. Generally, derivatives are financial contracts with value dependent upon, or derived from, the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index, and may relate to stocks, bonds, interest rates, currencies or currency exchange rates, and related indexes. The derivatives in which the Fund may invest include futures and forward currency agreements. These derivatives may be used for risk management purposes to manage or adjust the risk profile of the Fund. Futures on currencies and forward currency agreements may also be used to hedge against a specific currency. In addition, futures on indices may be used for investment (non-hedging) purposes to earn income; to enhance returns; to replace more traditional direct investments; or to obtain exposure to certain markets. Management Process The Sub-Adviser's investment decisions are based upon price/value discrepancies as identified by the Sub-Adviser's fundamental valuation process. In selecting securities for the portion of the Fund that is managed according to the Sub-Adviser's fundamental valuation process, the Sub-Adviser focuses on, among other considerations, identifying discrepancies between a security's fundamental value and its market price. In this context, the fundamental value of a given security is the Sub-Adviser's assessment of what a security is worth. The Sub-Adviser will select a security whose fundamental value it estimates to be greater than its market value at any given time. For each stock under analysis, the Sub-Adviser bases its estimates of value upon economic, industry and company analysis, as well as upon a company's management team, competitive advantage and core competencies. The Sub-Adviser then compares its assessment of a security's value against the prevailing market prices, with the aim of constructing a portfolio of stocks across industries with attractive relative price/value characteristics. 3 The Sub-Adviser will employ both a positive and negative screening process in selecting securities for the Fund. The positive screening process will identify securities of companies that are fundamentally attractive and that have superior valuation characteristics. In addition, the positive screening process will also include material, fundamental sustainability factors that the Sub-Adviser believes confirm the fundamental investment case and can enhance the ability to make good investment decisions. The sustainability factors are material extra-financial factors that evaluate the environmental, social and governance performance of companies that, along with more traditional financial analytics, identify companies that the Sub-Adviser believes will provide sustained, long-term value. The Sub-Adviser believes that the sustainability strategy provides the Fund with a high quality portfolio and mitigates risk. The Sub-Adviser also applies a negative screening process that will exclude from the Fund's portfolio securities with more than 5% of sales in industries such as alcohol, tobacco, defense, nuclear, GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms), water bottles, gambling and pornography, and will entirely exclude all firearms issuers and companies within the energy sector as defined by MSCI and its Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).\"},\n",

Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests between 50% and 75% of its net assets in equity securities and between 25% and 50% of its net assets in fixed-income securities. Stock investments are primarily common stock of large-cap companies. Fixed-income investments are primarily a wide variety of investment grade debt securities, such as corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") (including commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\")), and other asset-backed securities (\"ABS\"). An investment grade debt security is rated BBB- or higher by S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\") or an equivalent rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization (\"NRSRO\"), including Moody\\'s Investors Service, Inc.

Management of the Fund involves consideration of numerous factors (such as quality of business franchises, financial strength, management quality and security structural and collateral considerations). The portfolio managers may sell a security when the investment adviser\\'s price objective is reached, the fundamentals of the investment change or to pursue more attractive investment options.
